    Our story begins 
          as our young friend awakes from a dream. Bastian quickly sits up as if 
          awakening from a nightmare. He looks at a picture of his mom with a sigh 
          and then he picks up the book beside him and marks his spot. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    CUT TO: 
          Kitchen.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Bastians father 
          is working on some sort of concoction in the kitchen blender, while 
          Bastian sits at the dining table straining to open jelly for his toast. 
          They exchange a good morning between each other, but they are relatively 
          quiet.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
    Morning Bastian
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Morning Dad
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Bastian 
          continues to struggle with the jar until his hand hurts. His father turns 
          to him and gives him a hand. He seems to easily open the jar. As Bastians 
          father returns to his task of the morning drink concoction Bastian breaks 
          the silence.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    I had another dream Dad, about 
          Mom.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    His father pauses at the blender, but doesn't 
          look 
    
    
          
    
    at 
          him and then he continues creating his
    
    
          
    
    drink.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
    I understand 
          son, but we have to get on with things, right? (Bastian looks dejected at 
          this answer.) Bastian we each have responsibilities. We can't let Mom's 
          death be an excuse 
    
    
          
    
    for not getting the old job done, right ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Bastian 
          half-heartedly smears butter on his toast. His father approaches the table 
          and sits down. Time for a father to son talk.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
    Son, I think it's time 
          you and I had a little talk. 
    
    
          
    
    I got a call from your 
          math teacher yesterday. 
    
    
          
    
    She says you were 
          drawing horses in your math book.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Unicorns. They were unicorns.(mimics a 
          unicorn)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
    What ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Nothing.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
                
          She also says that you haven't been turning your homework 
    
    
          
    
          in on 
          time. And I'm very disappointed you didn't even try out for 
    
    
          
    
              the 
          swim-team.

          Pause ) 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
          As for 
          those riding lessons you've been wanting       
    
    
          
    
                             
          you say you love horses yet you seem to be afraid to get on a real

          (he takes a sip of drink.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Ok.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
    Stop daydreaming and 
          start facing your problems. 
    
    
          
    
                     
          Ok ? (ruffles Bastians hair)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Ok (he says with a half hearted 
          smile)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Father:_
    
    
          
    
                                                
          Ok. Right I think we've had a nice little talk we should have more. 
          (he gulps down his drink and gets up to leave.) Have a nice day and don't 
          be late to school again.

    Out on the street 3 
          bullies are laughing. As Bastian walks out, they stop.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bully 1:_
    
    
          
    
    Hey look it's the weirdo.

    Hey weirdo, got any cash for us today

    Bastian turns and runs.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bully 1:_
    
    
          
    
    Hey follow! That's it 
          weirdo. You can't get away 
    
    
          
    
                  
          you jerk ! You're dead chicken!
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    They yell 
          chasing after him. They chase him down an alley where they corner him and 
          catch him.

          No money? Momma's little boy is holding out

    All three bullies shove Bastian into a nearby

    Maybe chicken can lay an egg in there. (They laugh as they 
          return to the street.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Bastian comes 
          out of the dumpster and enters the street brushing garbage off himself. 
          The bullies see him and stand up straight.

    Bastian watches from inside the store as the 
          
    
    
          
    
    three bullies go running by. He sighs felling 
          relief, 
    
    
          
    
    but is suddenly startled by a ruff bulldog 
          voice 
    
    
          
    
    from somewhere in the 
          store.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Coreander:_
    
    
          
    
    Get outta here. I don't like

    Bastian walks toward the area he heard to 
          
    
    
          
    
    voice from, and finds an old man siting in 
          
    
    
          
    
    a chair reading. He turns and looks at 
          him.

    You still here boy? Didn't you hear what I 
          said?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Um, I was.. (he stutters motioning to the 
          door.)

          more)

    The video arcade is down the street . Here we just sell small

    Bah. Comic books.

          new interest.)

    Just some kids from 
          school.

    They wanna throw me in the 
          garbage.

    Why don't you give them a good punch in the nose, eh?

    The man turns away from 
          him again. Bastian looks at the book he has. His interest has been 
          aroused.

          special.

          ?

    Look. You're books are safe. While you're reading them you 
          get to become Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

          them.

    Yes, but afterwards you get to be a little boy again.

          nearer.)

          you ever been Captain Nemo, trapped inside your submarine while the giant 
          squid was attacking you ?

    Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape 
          ?

    But it's only a story.

    That's what I'm talking about. The ones you 
          read are safe.

    Don't worry about it.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    But, 
          but you just said it was.... (the phone rings and Coreander puts the book 
          under a newspaper to try and hide it.)

    Forget 
          about it. This book is not for you. (he gets up and gets the phone.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     Bastian watches him. As he talks on 
          the phone Bastian uncovers the book. The title on the book reads, The 
          Neverending Story. above these words is a symbol on the cover. The symbol 
          is two snakes intertwined with each other and biting each other's tail. As 
          the old man hangs up the phone, Bastian grabs the book and runs out. The 
          old man smiles to himself and looks down at his desk proud to have finally 
          gotten rid of the annoying child.

    With the book 
          under his shirt Bastian runs through the hall of his school. He stops 
          outside his classroom, then cautiously looks through the small slit of a 
          window in the classroom door. What he sees is his class already started on 
          a very important math test.

          of old scholastic objects in the attic. He finds a stack of old gym mats 
          and pulls one out. He sits down and pulls out the book, then he begins 
          reading.

    It was midnight in the Howling forest. The wind whistled 
          through the tops of the ancient trees. Suddenly, something enormous 
          crashed and rumbled through the eerie woods.

     We see a snail look up and there's 
          a small man beside him. There is a Nighthob and his sleeping bat nearby. 
          Suddenly the calm of the camp is interrupted by a great rumbling similar

    A huge tricycle 
          comes to a stop in front of them. It is made entirely from stone, as is 
          the giant riding it. The Rockbiter speaks to them in a deep, friendly

    Mmm. That was 
          limestone, with a dash of quartz. Very tasty. Where I come from in the 
          north we used to have exquisite gourmet rocks, only now...now they're all 
          gone.

     No, a hole would be something. Nah, 
          it was nothing. And it got bigger and bigger. First there was no lake 
          anymore and then finally, no rocks.

    Rockbiter, what

          sort of Nothing is destroying everything.

    The little man

    We span the 
          whole length of this Ivory Tower. It is said to be as big as a city. We 
          pass over the base of the tower, then its mid section, and finally we 
          near the very top of the structure. It is very intricate here. We begin to 
          zoom in on the Magnolia pavilion. The very tip of the Ivory Tower, the 
          place that the Empress lives.

    The door to the Empress's room opens into the

     Friends, I know why you are all 
          here. The nothing is destroying our world. I also know that you have come 
          to beseech the Empress for help. But I, I have terrible news. The Empress 
          herself has become deathly ill. There seems to be a mysterious link 
          between her illness and the nothing. She is dying. So she cannot save 
          us...

     hunt the purple buffalo have among 
          them a great warrior and 
    
    
          
    
    he alone has a chance to fight the nothing and 
          save us. He is 
    
    
          
    
    our only hope. His name is

    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     If 
          you don't want me here, 
    
    
          
    
    you shouldn't have sent for 
          me.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     It 
          was not you we sent for. We wanted Atreyu.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     I 
          am Atreyu.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion_
    
    
          
    
    Not Atreyu the child, Atreyu the 
          warrior.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     I 
          am the only Atreyu with the plains people, but I'll be happy to 
          go
    
    
          
    
    back to hunting the purple buffalo.  
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
           No 
          wait !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu pauses as the old man 
          continues..
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     Come back 
          please.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu walks back up the stairs. The old man 
          looks at him more urgently now.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     If 
          you truly are the Atreyu we sent for, you 
    
    
          
    
                                                             
          would be willing to go on a quest?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     Yes of course, what kind of a 
          quest?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     To 
          find a cure for the Empress .....and to save our 
          world.
    
    
          
    
    No one can give you any advice except this, you 
          must go
    
    
          
    
    alone and you must leave all your weapons 
          behind.
    
    
          
    
    It will be very 
    dangerous.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     Is 
          there any chance of success?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     I 
          do not know, but if you fail the Empress will surely 
          die
    
    
          
    
    and our whole world will be 
          destroyed.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu's eyes grow large and he closes them 
          
    
    
          
    
    and hangs his head down. Then he opens 
          
    
    
          
    
    them back up and looks at the old man 
          
    
    
          
    
    determinedly. He takes off his bow and 
          
    
    
          
    
    quiver of arrows. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     When do I begin ?  
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     Now and you must hurry 
          Atreyu,
    
    
          
    
    the nothing grows stronger 
          everyday.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    He motions him to come nearer. 
          
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     Take this. (He holds up a necklace 
          that has the same
    
    
          
    
    symbol as the front of the book. He fastens it 
          on Atreyu.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    " The Auryn" Could be heard whispered 
          
    
    
          
    
    throughout the court filled with 
          creatures.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Carion:_
    
    
          
    
     He 
          who wears the Auryn speaks for the Empress.
    
    
          
    
    It will guide and protect 
          you.

     At 
          the same time, elsewhere in Fantasia, a creature
    
    
          
    
    of darkness also began his 
          quest.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    We see two evil eyes open abruptly followed by 
          a horrid howl in the cave and then a wolf as black as night runs 
          out.

    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    They had been traveling aimlessly for almost a 
          week,
    
    
          
    
    but they could not find a cure for the Empress. 
          Neither
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu or his horse, Artax, had the vaguest 
          suspicion
    
    
          
    
    that the creature of darkness, the G'mork, was 
          already
    
    
          
    
    tracking them down.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Artax crosses the small stream and wakes up 
          Atreyu by nuzzling him. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     Wha ? What is it Artax. Is it time 
          to go already
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     Oh, I know what you want. It's time 
          to eat, 
    
    
          
    
    huh? Good idea.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
     No, it's a great idea! 
          
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Bastian looks up from the book with a smile 
          
    
    
          
    
    and grabbs his lunch from his back pack 
          
    
    
          
    
    and begins to devour it.

    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    No, not too much. We still have a long way to 
          go.

    G'mork arrives were they had been and catches 
          
    
    
          
    
    their scent, and takes off following their 
          trail.

          Atreyu and Artax had searched the Silver 
          Mountains,
    
    
          
    
    the Desert of Shattered Hopes, and the Crystal 
          Towers
    
    
          
    
    without success. And so, there was only one 
          chance left.
    
    
          
    
    To find Morla, the ancient one, the wisest 
          being in
    
    
          
    
    Fantasia whos home was the Shell 
          Mountain
    
    
          
    
    somewhere in the deadly Swamps of 
          Sadness.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu jumps off Artax and pulls him along 
          through the swamp.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
     Everyone knew that whoever let the 
          sadness
    
    
          
    
    overtake him would sink into the 
          swamp.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu pulls his horse along saying reassuring 
          things the whole time. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     That's it. Youre doing fine 
          Artax.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Suddenly Artax stops and Atreyu pulls on the 
          reigns. Artax doesn't budge
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Come on Artax, what's the matter? What's wrong? 
          Come on boy! 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    I understand, it's too difficult for you. (He 
          tries pulling him in a 
    
    
          
    
    different direction and steps into a puddle up 
          to his waist. 
    
    
          
    
    Suddenly he notices that Artax is 
          sinking)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Artax you're sinking! Come on turn around, you 
          have to! 
    
    
          
    
    Now ! Come on! Artax !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    He goes closer to him and hugs him. 
          
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
     Fight against the sadness Artax. 
          Artax, please.
    
    
          
    
    You're letting the sadness of the swamps get to 
          you.
    
    
          
    
    You have to try, you have to care. For me, I'm 
          your
    
    
          
    
    friend, I love you. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    (Artax doesn't move and 
          Atreyu
    
    
          
    
    slaps the puddle sending water flying toward 
          the
    
    
          
    
    horse. He yells at him 
          again.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Artax, you're sinking! Come on, turn around, 
          you have to, now!
    
    
          
    
    Come on! Artax! Fight against the sadness, 
          Artax. Artax, please,
    
    
          
    
    you're letting the sadness of the swamps get to 
          you. You have
    
    
          
    
    to try. You have to care, for me, you're my 
          friend, and I love you.
    
    
          
    
    Artax! Stupid horse! You've gotta move or 
          you'll die! Move, please!
    
    
          
    
    I won't give up! Don't quit! Artax! Please!

    Atreyu climbs up the muddy mountain and calls 
          for Morla several times. The mountain      starts 
          moving and he grabs a tree branch. The branch breaks and he slides down 
          the mountain, hurting his shoulder. He lands in the swamp ground below and 
          turns and crawls away to a tree nearby that faces the mountain. He climbs 
          it and sees a giant turtle head coming out of the mountain. Bastian 
          screams and Atreyu and Morla look around.

          recognize this?

    Well, we haven't seen the

    We haven't spoken to anyone 
          else for thousands of years,
    
    
          
    
    so we started talking to

    Morla, I bring terrible

     the Empress is very 
          ill?

    Not that it matters, but 
          yes. Actually we don't care.

    If I don't save her, she'll 
          die! There's a terrible nothing
    
    
          
    
    sweeping over the land. 
          Don't you care about that? !

    No, we're allergic to 
          youth.

          coming,
    
    
          
    
    you'll die to! Both of you!

    Die ? That at least would be 
          something.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    She starts to sneeze 
          again, but doesn't so Atreyu relaxes his grip 
    
    
          
    
    on the tree. Unknowing 
          that she can sneeze at any moment.

    Please tell me. You said you knew the 
          answer.
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
    She sneezes and blows 
          him out of the tree. She becomes agitated.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Morla:_
    
    
          
    
    We're tired of sneezing, go away. Nothing 
          matters.

    That's not true.
    
    
          
    
    If it didn't really matter to you then you'd 
          tell me.

    You can't . It's ten thousand miles 
          away.

          That's 
          right. Forget it. Good night.

    The school bell rings and Bastian sits up with 
          a start. The school day 
    
    
          
    
    Has ended and everyone is leaving. Bastian 
          walks out as the lights turn off. 
    
    
          
    
    The attic is spooky, it is dark and stormy. 
          Bastian grabs his 
    
    
          
    
    stuff and runs out of the attic, but then comes 
          back, shaking his head.

          No. Atreyu wouldn't quit now.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    He starts back towards the mat, but lightning 
          followed by a loud clap of thunder 
    
    
          
    
    Startles Bastian prompting him to leap 
          backwards. A wolf head from an old school festival falls down in front of 
          him and he screams in terror.

    View of Atreyu stumbling, exhausted through the 
          swamp. He falls several 
    
    
          
    
    times and has to stop for rest. His shoulder 
          really hurts him. Atreyu stumbles 
    
    
          
    
    into a puddle up to his neck and we see the 
          wolf running after him. As Atreyu 
    
    
          
    
    starts to faint he looks up and sees a dragon 
          coming towards him from high in
    
    
          
    
     the sky. The wolf reaches him right 
          as the dragon picks him up. The wolf 
    
    
          
    
    howls in anger as he misses the boy.

          Relieved that Atreyu 
    
    
          
    
    escaped the Gmork and the swamps, but what was 
          that creature 
    
    
          
    
    that saved him? Bastian sits back up and starts

    After days and nights of unconsciousness, 
          Atreyu slowly 
    
    
          
    
    opened his eyes and found himself in strange 
          surroundings. 
    
    
          
    
    He was clean and his wounds were 
          dressed.

          can get away. 
    
    
          
    
    The dragon opens one eye, then closes

    Oh yea. Huh huh huh, oh. 
          That's so good. Thank you.

    Oh, I wouldn't necessarily 
          say that.

          Oracle.

    Why don't you sit down and be quiet for once 
          ?!

    It's now my 
          turn.

     My 
          name is Engywook. Uh, she's Urgl. Ever heard of me? 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    I don't think so.

          apologetically and shook his head no.

    View of Urgl turning a handle of a large 
          machine that pulls a

          ledge on one 
    
    
          
    
    of the surrounding rocks. Atreyu follows him on 
          the ground.

    I've been studying the mystery of the Southern 
          Oracle for
    
    
          
    
    years, someday I'll publish my book : A Century 
          of Studying
    
    
          
    
    The Southern Oracle by Professor Engywook, 
          volume one
    
    
          
    
    The Early Years.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Have you ever been to the Southern Oracle 
          ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Well, what do you think? I work 
          scientifically.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    As Atreyu pulls himself up on the ledge he sees 
          2 great sphinx-like statues. 
    
    
          
    
    The man looks into a improvised sort of 
          telescope and then tells Atreyu to do the same.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Is that the Southern Oracle 
          ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Well, no. It's the first of 
          the 2 gates you must pass through
    
    
          
    
    before you reach the 
          Southern Oracle and get me the final
    
    
          
    
    information for my book. Of 
          course, most people never get
    
    
          
    
    that 
          far.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Why?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    The sphinx's eyes stay 
          closed until someone who does
    
    
          
    
    not feel his own worth tries 
          to pass by. Ah !
    
    
          
    
    Here comes one that looks 
          fancy.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    VIEW of a man in fancy 
          armor approaching the gate.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Let's see what he really thinks of 
          himself
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    (Atreyu watches through the 
          telescope.
    
    
          
    
    The man starts to 
          hesitate.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Go on scaredy cat. Oh, go 
          on!
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Oh, it's my turn, let me 
          see.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    (Atreyu ignores 
          him.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    I'm the 
          scientist.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    He's going on. I think he's 
          gonna make it.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_

          The sphinx's eyes, are they open are shut? Let me see 
          !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    They're 
          shut.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    (he looks back and forth 
          between them.)
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    No wait ! The eyes are open 
          ! 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Rays of pure light shoot out of the sphinx's 
          eyes and zap the man. Atreyu looks up, shocked at the sight he had 
          seen.
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Oh no! Did he make it ? Did 
          he?
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    (Atreyu shakes his head.) 
          No.
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Fancy armor doesn't help much. The sphinxes can 
          see
    
    
          
    
    straight into your heart. Listen boy, next time 
          let me see
    
    
          
    
    what happens ! It's my 
          telescope.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    (Atreyu sets his jaw 
          determinedly.) I'm gonna try it.
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu starts climbing down as Engywook calls 
          after him
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    No ! Don't go yet. I haven't told you about the 
          next gate.
    
    
          
    
    It's even worse than this one. Atreyu ! Atreyu 
          !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu continues on and approaches the gate. As 
          he walks up the eyes stay closed.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    He'll never make it. He'll never make 
          it.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu does fine until he sees the fallen man, 
          who is just a charred skeleton. He panics and starts looking back and 
          forth between the 2 sphinxes. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    (The old man cries out.)
    
    
          
    
    Don't start to doubt yourself now ,be confident 
          ! 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    (Bastian cries out )
    
    
          
    
    Be confident , be 
          confident.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    The eyes open and Bastian cries 
          out.
    
    
          
    
                
          _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Run Atreyu run 
          !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Engywook:_
    
    
          
    
    Run Atreyu 
          !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu looks straight ahead and Bastian calls 
          out.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Bastian:_
    
    
          
    
    Run now! 
          
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu runs through the gate and just barely 
          makes it. He turns and looks back, then sighs.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Engywook is so happy he jumps in the basket and 
          falls out when he gets back to where Falkor and Urgl 
          are.

    He made it, Atreyu, he made it through the 
          sphinx gate.
    
    
          
    
    I always said he could do 
          it.
    
    
          
    
                
          _Urgl_ :
    
    
          
    
     Oh good ! But that's no reason for 
          you to go falling out of the Basket again?

    I knew he would be 
          safe.

    Nonsense ! You don't

          up.
    
    
          
    
    Next is the Magic Mirror

    Atreyu has to face his true

    So what ? That won't be too 
          hard for him.

    Oh ! That's what everyone 
          thinks. But kind people
    
    
          
    
    find that they are cruel, 
          brave men discover that
    
    
          
    
    they are really cowards. 
          Confronted with their true

          Mirror gate and looks into it.
    
    
          
    
     After a while, he sees Bastian 
          reading the story. Bastian looks up then 
    
    
          
    
    throws the book across the 
          room.

    No. This is going too

    What if they really do know 
          about me in Fantasia?

    Then he walks through the 
          gate.

    Great storm clouds can be seen all around 
          churning and expanding.
    
    
          
    
    It is the Nothing, the force destroying 
          fantasia, and Falkor and Atreyu
    
    
          
    
    Have ended up right in the center of part of

    Falkor is tossed around in all directions, 
          Atreyu tries to hold on as best as he can. The wind blows wilder and 
          wilder until finally it tosses Falkor onto his back, and knocks his 
          passenger into the air. Atreyu falls, but Falkor cannot get to him before 
          he disappears into the chaos below.

    The window bursts open and Bastian climbs up 
          and closes it. Against a torrent of rain and wind. Finally he gets the 
          window closed and he looks down at the book, he is soaked, and a bit 
          winded at his experience. Then he remembers the story

    not there. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Falkor !Falkor !Where are 
          you? Falkor !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Somewhere in the heavens 
          Falkor is searching for Atreyu.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Falkor:_
    
    
          
    
    View of Falkor calling for Atreyu." Atreyu ! 
          Atreyu !
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Falkor !
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu reluctantly gives up on calling Falkor. 
          He turns his eyes 
    
    
          
    
    to the beach, he finds a trail of foot prints 
          in the sand, but they were not his, 
    
    
          
    
    but that of a large beast. Atreyu follows them 
          and Finds himself following a 
    
    
          
    
    path to a city that has seen better days.On his 
          way he stopps to rest leaning 
    
    
          
    
    against the remains of what seems like a stone 
          wall, but he soon finds that it 
    
    
          
    
    was not a wall at all, but a Rockbiter. The 
          giant looks down at atreyu and holds
    
    
          
    
     out his 
    hands.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Rockbiter:_
    
    
          
    
    They look like big, good, 
          strong hands. Don't they?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
           
          (Atreyu looks down saddened.)
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
             
          I always thought that's what they were. My little 
          friends.
    
    
          
    
          The little 
          man with his racing snail, the Nighthob, even
    
    
          
    
        the stupid bat. I 
          couldn't hold on to them. The nothing
    
    
          
    
    pulled them right out of my hands. I failed. 
          
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu looks down, feeling terrible. 
          
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    No you didn't fail. I'm the 
          one who was chosen to stop the nothing.
    
    
          
    
    But I lost the Auryn, I 
          can't find my luck dragon, so I won't be able
    
    
          
    
    to get past the boundaries 
          of Fantasia.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Rockbiter:_
    
    
          
    
    Listen, the nothing will be 
          here any minute.
    
    
          
    
    I will just sit here and let 
          it take me away too.
    
    
          
    
    They look like big, good, 
          strong hands. Don't they?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Rockbiter starts crying as Atreyu shakes his 
          head yes and fights his own tears. 
    
    
          
    
    He continues along the trail again, and finds 
          himself in a different part of the city. 
    
    
          
    
    Ahead of him is a larce mostly intact building, 
          Atreyu dodges falling rocks and 
    
    
          
    
    enters an opening. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    On the walls are paintings of everything that's 
          happened during his Quest. 
    
    
          
    
    The Empress giving the Auryn to Carion, Carion 
          giving the Auryn to Atreyu,
    
    
          
    
     Atreyu trying to save Artax in the 
          Swamps of Sadness, Morla, and Falkor, 
    
    
          
    
    and more.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    As Atreyu turns a corner he sees a painting of 
          a wolf, then he turns another
    
    
          
    
     corner and sees the wolf hiding in 
          a smaller opening. It growls wildly at Atreyu 
    
    
          
    
    as he approaches
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
    _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    If you come any closer I 
          will rip you to shreds.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu squats down where he's at and looks at 
          the wolf. 
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Who are 
          you?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    I am G'mork. And you, 
          whoever you are,
    
    
          
    
    can have the honor of being 
          my last victim.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    I will not die easily. I am 
          a warrior.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    (G'mork laughs.) Brave 
          warrior, then fight the nothing.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    But I can't ! I can't get 
          beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    G'mork laughs and Atreyu grows 
          angry.
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    What's so funny about that 
          ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    Fantasia has no 
          boundaries.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    A storm grows closer to the city, slowly 
          shaking it to pieces
    
    
          
    
     Rocks fall here and 
          there.
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    That's not true. You're 
          lying.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    Foolish boy. Don't you know 
          anything about Fantasia?
    
    
          
    
    It's the world of human 
          fantasy. Every part ,every
    
    
          
    
    creature of it, is a piece 
          of the dreams and hopes of mankind.
    
    
          
    
    Therefor, it has no 
          boundaries.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    There's a crash and more rocks 
          fall.
    
    
          
    
                
          
    
    
          
    
    _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    But why is Fantasia dying 
          then ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    Because people have begun to loose their 
          hopes
    
    
          
    
    and forget their dreams. So the nothing grows 
          stronger.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    What is the nothing 
          ?!
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    It's the emptiness that's 
          left. It's like a despair,
    
    
          
    
    destroying this world. And I 
          have been trying to help it.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    But why 
          ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    Because people who have no 
          hopes are easy to control.
    
    
          
    
    And whoever has control has 
          the power.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    A large crash shakes the ground. Atreyu loses 
          his balance for a moment, 
    
    
          
    
    but quickly regains it and turns back to the 
          wolf. He gives him a cold look 
    
    
          
    
    then asks him, 
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    Who are you really 
          ?
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Gmork:_
    
    
          
    
    I am the servant of the 
          power behind the nothing.
    
    
          
    
    I was sent to kill the only 
          one who could have
    
    
          
    
    stopped the nothing. I lost 
          him in the Swamps of
    
    
          
    
    Sadness. His name was 
          Atreyu.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    The ground shakes and Atreyu falls over 
          backward. He grabs a long, sharp 
    
    
          
    
    piece of broken stone and stands up. He then 
          yells at G'mork.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
                
          _Atreyu:_
    
    
          
    
    If we're about to die 
          anyway, I'd rather die fighting.
    
    
          
    
    Come for me G'mork ! I am 
          Atreyu!
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    G'mork growls and jumps at him. Atreyu plunges 
          the sharp rock into the beasts 
    
    
          
    
    heart, killing the Gmork. As Atreyu pulls 
          himself from the carcass of the Gmork,
    
    
          
    
     Atreyu finds that the beast managed 
          to inflict a wound on Atreyu. He stands and
    
    
          
    
     winces at the deep gash across his 
          chest. Another crash echoes through the 
    
    
          
    
    ruins as Atreyu makes his way out of the 
          ruins.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    CUT TO- Ocean Falkor 
          under water
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Falkor dived deep into the Sea following a 
          slight ray of light from beneath the 
    
    
          
    
    waves. As he swims deeper and deeper more and 
          more bubbles form around
    
    
          
    
    his body, finally he reaches a coral reef, and 
          finds that the ray of light was 
    
    
          
    
    coming from the lost necklace. Falkor opens his 
          mouth, and plucks the Auryn
    
    
          
    
     from the coral with his 
          teeth.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Driven by a will much like his own he headed 
          straight for the abandoned city. 
    
    
          
    
    Below him he could barely make out the form of 
          Atryeu leaving a collapsing 
    
    
          
    
    building.
    
    
          
    
     
    
    
          
    
    Atreyu comes out of an opening and latches onto 
          a tree as the Nothing consumes 
    
    
          
    
    more and more the surrounding land. Atreyu 
          calls out for Falkor and this time Falkor

    to them and Rockbiter waves back. They change 
          their direction and suddenly below them is a great endless field, the 
          Great Plains. Bastian looks down and sees a familiar face from his 
          imagination, only now its real.

    They run down the alley and jump into the 
          dumpster as Falkor flies by them, laughing. They peer out of the dumpster 
          and then duck back in.
