Steven Jay Russell is on his deathbed , recalling the events of his life that led him to this point . He spent his early adult years in Virginia Beach as a police officer . He plays the organ at church , has unenthusiastic sex with his wife , Debbie , and spends his off-hours searching for his biological mother , who had placed him for adoption as a child . Steven locates his biological mother , but she rejects him . He then quits the police force and moves to Texas and works for Sysco , the family business . After a car crash on the way to a homosexual tryst , Steven leaves his family and life behind , though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter , and explores the world as his true self â a gay man . He moves to Miami , where he finds a boyfriend , Jimmy , and they adopt a luxurious lifestyle . To keep themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed , Steven becomes a con man . Steven is pursued by the police , and , after jumping off a parking garage , is sent to prison , where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris . Steven can not bear to be separated from Phillip . After being released , he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer , then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as Chief Financial Officer of a large medical management company called USAMM . Steven eventually is caught embezzling . While in the police car he reminisces about Jimmy in Florida dying of AIDS . He asks the police for Phillips insulin and injects himself . He goes back to prison , Phillip is also sent to prison as an accomplice and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again . Months later , Phillip learns from another inmate that Steven is dying of AIDS . Heartbroken , Phillip calls Steven while he is in the infirmary and confesses that , while he is still upset with Steven for lying to him , he still loves him . Phillip is later told that Steven has died . Sometime later , Phillip is taken to meet with his lawyer and finds Steven waiting for him . Steven describes how he faked dying of AIDS , to be allowed to see Phillip again , and promises never to lie to him again . He runs one last con to break Phillip out of prison , only to be caught when he runs into an old co-worker . The end of the movie explains that the real-life Phillip Morris was released from prison in 2006 ; but Steven was given a life sentence and is in 23-hour lockup , only having one free hour a day to shower and exercise , which the film implies to be because an official involved in the sentencing had a nephew who was conned by Morris . The last scene shows Steven laughing joyfully while running across the prison yard , guards in pursuit , in another attempt to be with Phillip .
