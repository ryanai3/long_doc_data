On October 30 , 1977 , Jerry Goldsmith , Bill Hudley , Mary Knowles , and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . When the four meet Captain Spaulding , the owner of a gas station and The Museum of Monsters & Madmen , they learn the local legend of Dr. Satan . As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged , they pick up a young hitchhiker named Baby , who claims to live only a few miles away . Shortly after , the vehicle s tire bursts in what is later seen to be a trap and Baby takes Bill to her family s house . Moments later , Baby s half-brother , Rufus , picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home . There they meet Baby s family : Mother Firefly , Otis Driftwood , her adopted brother , Grampa Hugo and Baby s deformed giant half-brother , Tiny . While being treated to dinner , Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband , Earl , had previously tried to burn Tiny alive , along with the Firefly house . After dinner , the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill . After Mary threatens Baby , Rufus tells them their car is repaired . As they leave , Otis and Tiny , disguised as scarecrows , attack the couples in the drive way and take them prisoner . The next day , Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art . Mary is tied up in a barn , Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween , and Jerry is partially scalped for failing to guess Baby s favorite movie star . When Denise does n't come home , her father Don calls the police to report her missing . Two deputies , George Wydell and Steve Naish , find the couples ' abandoned car in a field with a tortured victim in the trunk . Don , who was once a cop , is called to the scene to help the deputies search . They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens . Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the neck and kills him , and Don and Steve are then killed by Otis upon finding other bodies in the barn . Later that night , the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits , and taken out to an abandoned well . Mary attempts to run away , but is stabbed to death by Baby moments later . Meanwhile , Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well , where a group of undead men pull Jerry away , leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair . As she wanders through the tunnels , she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of mental patients ; Jerry is on Dr. Satan s operating table being vivisected . Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant , who turns out to be Earl , Mother Firefly s ex-husband , to capture Denise , but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface . She makes her way to the main road , where she encounters Captain Spaulding , who gives her a ride in his car . She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat , and Otis suddenly appears in the backseat with a knife . Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan s operating table , with Dr. Satan standing there .
