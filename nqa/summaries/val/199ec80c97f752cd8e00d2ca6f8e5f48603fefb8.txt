Launched in 1977 , the Voyager 2 space probe carried a gold phonographic disk with a message of peace , inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth . The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth . However , instead of greeting the alien craft , the US government shoots it down . Crashing in Chequamegon Bay , Wisconsin , the lone alien occupant , looking like a floating ball of glowing energy , finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden ( Karen Allen ) . While there , the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband , Scott , to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches . The alien Starman ( Jeff Bridges ) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats . He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed . He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days ' time . He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States , coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona . Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape . Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk , the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm . He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point , Arizona s Barringer Crater , in three days , he will die . Sympathetic but still wary , Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards so he can continue the journey alone , but when she witnesses him miraculously resurrect a dead deer , she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him . However , they are pursued across the country by the authorities and , after nearly being caught , Jenny is shot and critically wounded by a police officer . In order to escape , the Starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect the two of them from the explosion . They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed . He uses another silver sphere to heal Jenny . After being assured that Jenny will recover , the Starman proceeds to hitchhike towards Arizona without her , but Jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock . Reunited , the two of them hitchhike together , resuming their journey towards the crater . Later , while stowing away on a boxcar train , the couple makes love . The Starman tells Jenny I gave you a baby tonight . Jenny explains that she is infertile and can not have children , but he assures her she is now pregnant . He explains that the baby will be the son of her dead husband , because he ( Starman ) is a clone of Scott , but as a child of Starman as well , their son will possess all of the Starman s knowledge and will grow up to be a teacher . Starman offers to stop the pregnancy if she wishes , but the joyful Jenny embraces him , accepting the gift . The couple mistakenly travel too far on the train and arrive in Las Vegas . Jenny realizes she has lost her wallet . The Starman uses one of their last quarters in a slot machine , which he manipulates in order to win the $ 500,000 jackpot . They then buy a new car to complete their journey to Arizona . Meanwhile , National Security Agency director George Fox learns that the Starman s flight trajectory , prior to being shot down , was to the Barringer Crater . Fox arranges to have the Starman captured by the Army , dead or alive . SETI scientist Mark Shermin , another government official involved in the case , criticizes Fox s heavy-handed approach and reminds him that the Starman was invited to Earth . Appalled to learn that Fox is planning to vivisect the alien , Shermin then resolves to help the Starman escape rather than allow Fox to capture him . Jenny and the now dying Starman reach the crater as Army helicopters pursue them . Just as they are surrounded , a large , spherical spaceship appears and descends into the crater . Light surrounds the couple , and the Starman is instantly restored to health . As he prepares to leave , he tells Jenny he will never see her again . Jenny begs him to take her with him , but he says she would die on his world . He then gives her his last silver sphere , telling her that their son will know what to do with it . Jenny watches as the ship departs .
