Several thousand years ago , the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions , the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron . Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark , a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet , into space , but Megatron pursued it . Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze , and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky . Witwicky activated Megatron’s navigational system , which scanned the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses . The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky . In the present , Sam buys his first car , a rusting Chevrolet Camaro , but discovers it has a life of its own . In modern Qatar , Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark . A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert , pursued by Blackout’s drone Scorponok . They fight Scorponok off , aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponok’s stinger , discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor . At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack . Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon , Frenzy , hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One . While the hack is thwarted , Frenzy downloads files on Archibald’s glasses , tracking down Sam with Barricade , disguised as a police car . Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee , but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio . Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots , Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus , Jazz , Ironhide , and Ratchet . Optimus explains the details of their situation , revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind . Sam , Mikaela , and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses , but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven , a top secret government branch led by Seymour Simmons . The Autobots stop the agents , but Simmons calls for backup , who take Sam , Mikaela , and Bumblebee into custody with Optimus obtaining the glasses . The respective groups connected to the Transformers are gathered together at Hoover Dam by Sector Seven’s director Tom Banachek . Inside , the group discover the frozen Megatron and the AllSpark , but Frenzy , who smuggled away in Mikaela’s bag , summons the other Decepticons to attack . Bumblebee is released to protect the AllSpark , shrinking it down to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety . Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out . A lengthy battle occurs in Mission City ( but was clearly filmed in Los Angeles ) , with most of the Decepticons being killed , but Megatron murders Jazz . He prevents Sam’s attempted escape with the AllSpark , and begins to fight Optimus . After a long brawl Megatron seems to get the upper hand . Optimus then tells Sam to push the cube into his chest , but Sam rams it into Megatron s chest instead , extinguishing his spark . Starscream is the only Decepticon to escape , but Barricade remains on Earth . Optimus salvages a shard of the AllSpark from Megatron’s body . The United States government shuts down Sector Seven , disposing of the dead Decepticons in the Laurentian Abyss . Sam and Mikaela then start a relationship while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth , Optimus sends a transmission into space inviting any surviving Autobots to join them .
