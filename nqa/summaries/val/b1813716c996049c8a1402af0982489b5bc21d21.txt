Captain Jean-Luc Picard wakes from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier ( shown in the television episode The Best of Both Worlds ) . Starfleet informs him of a new Borg attack against Earth , but orders the USS Enterprise-E to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone so as not to introduce an unstable element to the fight . Learning that the fleet is losing the battle , the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth , where a single , damaged Borg Cube opposes a group of Starfleet vessels . The Enterprise arrives in time to save the crew of the USS Defiant , which is being commanded by Lieutenant Commander Worf . After Picard hears Borg communications in his mind , he orders the fleet to concentrate its firepower on a seemingly non-vital section of the Borg ship . The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet . The Borg sphere generates and enters a temporal vortex . As the Enterprise is enveloped in the vortex , the crew briefly glimpses an Earth populated entirely by Borg . Picard realizes that the Borg have used time travel to change history , and orders the Enterprise to follow . The Enterprise arrives in the past , on April 4 , 2063 , the day before humanity s first encounter with alien life after Zefram Cochrane s historic warp flight . The Borg sphere fires on the planet ; the Enterprise crew then destroy the sphere and , realizing that the Borg were trying to prevent first contact , send an away team to the Montana missile complex where Cochrane is building his ship , the Phoenix , to look for survivors . Picard sends Cochrane s assistant Lily Sloane to the Enterprise for medical attention , then returns to the ship and leaves Commander William Riker on Earth to make sure the Phoenix s flight proceeds as planned . The Enterprise crew sees Cochrane as a legend , but the real man is reluctant to assume his historical role . Borg survivors invade the Enterprise , and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship , planning to use it to attack and conquer Earth . Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core , but the android Data is captured and meets the queen of the Borg Collective , who gains his trust by giving part of him human skin . A frightened Sloane seizes the captain but he gains her trust , and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck . Picard , Worf , and the ship s navigator , Lieutenant Hawk , stop the Borg from calling reinforcements with the deflector dish , but Hawk is assimilated . As the Borg continue to assimilate , Worf suggests destroying the ship , but Picard angrily calls him a coward and vows to continue the fight . Sloane confronts the captain and , reminding him of Moby-Dick s Captain Ahab , makes him realize his own irrational behavior . Picard activates the ship s self-destruct mechanism , orders the crew to abandon ship , and then apologizes to Worf . While the crew heads to escape pods , Picard remains aboard to rescue Data . As Cochrane , Riker , and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on the Phoenix , Picard confronts the Borg Queen and discovers she has grafted human skin onto Data , giving him an array of new sensations . She has presented this modification as a gift to the android , hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer . Although Picard offers himself in Data s place , the android refuses to leave . He deactivates the self-destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix , but they miss and the Queen realizes Data has betrayed her . Data ruptures a coolant tank , and the corrosive substance fatally dissolves the Borg s biological components . Cochrane completes his warp flight , and that night , April 5 , 2063 , the crew watches as Vulcans , attracted by the Phoenix warp flight , land and greet Cochrane . Having repaired history , the Enterprise crew returns to the 24th century .
