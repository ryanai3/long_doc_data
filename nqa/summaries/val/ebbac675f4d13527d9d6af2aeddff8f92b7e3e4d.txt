Eight men eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner before executing their planned diamond heist . Six of them use aliases : Mr. Blonde , Mr. Blue , Mr. Brown , Mr. Orange , Mr . Pink , and Mr. White . The others are mob boss Joe Cabot and his son and underboss , Nice Guy Eddie Cabot , who are responsible for planning the job . After fleeing the scene of the crime , White drives Orange to the rendezvous in one of Joe s warehouses . Orange , having been shot during the escape , is severely bleeding out . Pink arrives in an angry mood ; he believes the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them . White informs him that Brown is dead and that both Blue and Blonde are missing . He also mentions that Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist . As he and Joe are old friends , White is furious that he would employ such a psychopath . Pink reveals that he has hidden the diamonds nearby , but argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange . Blonde arrives and tells the others that Eddie is en route to meet them . He then brings out a kidnapped policeman , Marvin Nash , and has White and Pink beat him for information about who set them up . Eddie arrives and orders them to retrieve the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles , leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange . Nash denies knowing anything , but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture , cutting off his right ear with a straight razor . He then tries to set Nash on fire , but is subsequently shot dead by Orange . Orange explains that he is really an undercover police officer and that the police have been tracking him . When Eddie , Pink , and White return , Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself . After finishing off Nash , Eddie accuses him of lying , since Blonde was loyal to his father . Joe then arrives with news that the police have found and killed Blue . Having found proof of Orange s true loyalties , he moves to execute him , but White intervenes and holds him at gunpoint . Eddie in turn points his own weapon at White , creating a Mexican standoff . The three shoot ; both Cabots are killed , and White and Orange are mortally wounded . Spooked , Pink takes the diamonds and flees . As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms , the latter confesses the truth . Without saying a word , White aims his last bullet at Orange s head . The police storm the warehouse and order White to drop his gun . Gunshots sound and White collapses .
