When a flying saucer lands in Washington , D.C. , the Army quickly surrounds the spaceship . A humanoid ( Michael Rennie ) emerges , announcing that he has come in peace . As he advances , he unexpectedly opens a small device and is shot by a nervous soldier . A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers ' weapons with an energy ray . The alien orders the robot , Gort , to stop . He explains that the broken device was a gift for the President , which would have enabled him to study life on the other planets . The alien is taken to Walter Reed Hospital , where he reveals his name : Klaatu . After surgery , Klaatu uses a salve to quickly heal himself . Meanwhile , the military is unable to enter his saucer ; Gort stands outside , silent and unmoving . Klaatu tells the President s secretary , Mr. Harley ( Frank Conroy ) , that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world s leaders simultaneously . Harley tells him that such a meeting in the current political climate is impossible . Klaatu suggests that he be allowed to go among humans to better understand their unreasoning suspicions and attitudes . Harley rejects the proposal and leaves Klaatu under guard . Klaatu escapes and lodges at a boarding house as Mr. Carpenter , the name on the dry cleaner s tag on the suit he borrowed . Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson ( Patricia Neal ) and her son Bobby ( Billy Gray ) . The next morning , Klaatu listens to the boarders speculate about why the alien has come . While Helen and her boyfriend Tom Stephens ( Hugh Marlowe ) go out , Klaatu babysits Bobby . The boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city , including a visit to his father s grave in Arlington National Cemetery ; Klaatu learns that most of those buried there were killed in wars . The two visit the Lincoln Memorial , then the heavily guarded spaceship . Klaatu asks Bobby who is the greatest living person ; Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt ( Sam Jaffe ) , who lives in the capital . Bobby takes Klaatu to Barnhardt s home , but the professor is absent . Klaatu adds a mathematical equation to a problem on Barnhardt s blackboard and leaves his contact information with the suspicious housekeeper . That evening , a government agent takes Klaatu to Barnhardt . Klaatu explains that the people of the other planets have safety concerns now that humanity has developed rockets and a rudimentary form of atomic power . Klaatu declares that if his message is ignored , Earth will be eliminated . Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the spaceship ; he then suggests that Klaatu give a harmless demonstration of his power . Klaatu returns to his ship that night , unaware that Bobby has followed him . Bobby sees Gort knock out two sentries and Mr. Carpenter enter the spaceship . Bobby tells Helen and Tom what he saw , but they do not believe him until Tom takes a diamond he found in Klaatu s room to a jeweler and learns it is unlike any other on Earth . Klaatu finds Helen at her workplace , and they take an empty service elevator which abruptly stops precisely at noon . Klaatu reveals his identity and his mission , then asks for her help . He has neutralized all electricity everywhere , except for such things as hospitals and aircraft in flight . Exactly 30 minutes later , the blackout ends . When Tom informs the military of his suspicions , Helen breaks up with him . Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to Barnhardt s home . En route , he tells her that should anything happen to him , she must tell Gort Klaatu barada nikto . Klaatu s taxi is spotted and hemmed in ; he makes a break for it and is gunned down . Helen quickly heads to the saucer . Gort disintegrates both sentries and advances on her . When Helen utters Klaatu s three words , the robot carries her into the saucer , then leaves to retrieve Klaatu s body . Later , Gort revives Klaatu . Klaatu explains to Helen that his revival is only temporary , that the power of life and death is reserved for the Almighty Spirit . Klaatu and Helen emerge from the spaceship and tells Barnhardt s assembled scientists that the people of Earth can join the other planets in peace , but should they threaten to extend their violence into space , this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder . Klaatu and Gort then fly away .
