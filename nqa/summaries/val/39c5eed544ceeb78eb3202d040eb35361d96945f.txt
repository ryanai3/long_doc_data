Five years after the Viking village of Berk and the dragons made peace , they now live together in harmony . Hiccup goes on adventures with his dragon , Toothless , as they discover and map unexplored lands . Now 20 years old , he is being pressed by his father , Stoick the Vast , to succeed him as chieftain , although Hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility . While investigating a burnt forest , Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by Eret , who blames them for his fort s destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist . The two dragon riders escape and return to Berk to warn Stoick about the dragon army that Drago is amassing . Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle . Hiccup , however , refuses to believe that war is inevitable . After Stoick interrupts Hiccup s plan to get Eret to take him to Drago , Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs , where Drago , mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude , murdered them all using armored dragons , with Stoick as the only survivor . Undeterred , Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him . They run into a dragon rider named Valka , who is revealed to be Hiccup s long-lost mother . She explains that she , like her son , could not bring herself to kill dragons . After being carried off during a dragon raid , she spent twenty years rescuing dragons from Drago s traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic Alpha dragon called a Bewilderbeast , which is able to control smaller dragons . Stoick tracks Hiccup to the nest , where he discovers that his wife is still alive . Meanwhile , Astrid and the other riders kidnap Eret to find Drago , but Drago captures them and learns of Berk s dragons . Drago and his armada lay siege to the nest , where he reveals that he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the Alpha . A battle ensues between the two colossal dragons , which ends with Drago s Bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new Alpha . Drago s Bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons , who hypnotically obey . Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence , but Drago orders him killed . Toothless , under the Bewilderbeast s influence , approaches Hiccup and launches a blast , but Stoick pushes Hiccup out of the way and is hit instead , killing him . The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless , but Hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair . Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless , again under the control of the Bewilderbeast , to lead his army to conquer Berk . Stoick is given a Viking funeral and Hiccup , now having lost both his father and dragon , is unsure what to do . Valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons , and inspired by her words and his father s , Hiccup decides to return to Berk to stop Drago . The dragon riders fly baby dragons back to Berk , as they are immune to the Bewilderbeast s control . They find that Drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons . Hiccup confronts Drago and a brainwashed Toothless while the other riders work to distract the Bewilderbeast . Hiccup succeeds in freeing Toothless from the Bewilderbeast s control , much to Drago s surprise . Hiccup and Toothless briefly separate Drago from the Bewilderbeast and confront Drago on the ground , but the Bewilderbeast attacks them , encasing them in ice . However , Toothless blasts away the ice , revealing that both he and Hiccup are unharmed . He then challenges the Bewilderbeast , shooting it in the face repeatedly , which breaks its control over the other dragons , who now side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon . All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast , breaking its left tusk . Defeated , the Bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with Drago on its back . The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk . Afterwards , Berk undergoes repairs while feeling secure knowing that its dragons can defend it .
