Melvin Udall ( Jack Nicholson ) is a 60 year old misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City working on his 62nd book . He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which , paired with his misanthropy , alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts . He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck , and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs . He takes an interest in his waitress , Carol Connelly ( Helen Hunt ) , the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior . One day , Melvin s apartment neighbor , a gay artist named Simon Bishop ( Greg Kinnear ) , is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery . Melvin is intimidated by Simon s agent , Frank Sachs ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , into caring for Simon s dog , Verdell , while Simon is hospitalized . Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog , Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it . He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol . When Simon is released from the hospital , Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog . Melvin s life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence ( Jesse James ) . Unable to adjust to another waitress , Melvin arranges through his publisher ( Linda Gehringer ) whose husband is a doctor ( Harold Ramis ) to pay for her son s considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work . She is overwhelmed at his generosity , and they agree there will be no physical relationship . Meanwhile , Simon s assault and rehabilitation , coupled with Verdell s preference for Melvin , causes Simon to lose his creative muse . Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills . Frank convinces him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money . Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself , Melvin reluctantly agrees to do so ; Frank lends Melvin the use of his Saab 900 convertible for the trip . Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness . She reluctantly accepts the invitation , and relationships among the three develop . Once in Baltimore , Carol persuades Melvin to take her out to have dinner . Melvin s comments during the dinner greatly flatterâand subsequently upsetâCarol , and she abruptly leaves . Upon seeing the frustrated Carol , Simon begins to sketch her semi-nude in his hotel room and rekindles his creativity , once more feeling a desire to paint . He briefly reconnects with his parents , but is able to tell them that he ll be fine . After returning to New York , Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore . She later regrets her statement and calls him to apologize . The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon ( who Melvin has allowed to move in with him until he can fully heal from his injuries and get a new apartment ) convinces Melvin to declare his love for her . Melvin goes to see Carol , who is hesitant , but agrees to try and establish a relationship with him . The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together . As he opens a door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol , he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement .
