Karl Childers ( Billy Bob Thornton ) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover . Although thoroughly institutionalized , Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world . Prior to his release , he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter , to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade , saying , Some folks call it a sling blade . I call it a kaiser blade . Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother . When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair , he killed her also . Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization ( James Hampton ) , Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised . He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley ( Lucas Black ) and shares some of the details of his past , including the killings . Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own . He later admits that he lied , and that his father committed suicide . Frank introduces Karl to his mother , Linda ( Natalie Canerday ) , as well as her gay friend , Vaughan Cunningham ( John Ritter ) , the manager of the dollar store where she is employed . Despite Vaughan s concerns about Karl s history in the mental hospital , Linda allows him to move into her garage , which angers Linda s abusive alcoholic boyfriend , Doyle Hargraves ( Dwight Yoakam ) . Karl bonds with Linda , who makes him biscuits to eat , and also with Vaughan , who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America . Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank , who misses his father and despises Doyle . Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature , unwanted , newborn brother . He visits his father ( Robert Duvall ) , who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home where Karl grew up . Karl s parents performed an abortion , causing the baby to come out too soon , and Karl was given a bloody towel wrapped around the baby , which survived the abortion . Karl was instructed to get rid of it , but when Karl detected movement inside the towel , he inspected it , discovering a little ol ' boy that was n't no bigger than a squirrel . While recounting this story to Frank , Frank asks why Karl just did n't keep the baby , but Karl replies he had no way to care for a baby . He placed the baby , still in the bloody towel , inside a shoe box and buried the baby alive , saying he felt it was better to just return him to the good Lord right off the bat , because of the abuse and neglect he himself had received at the hands of his own parents . Karl tells his father that killing the baby was wrong , and that he had wanted to kill his father for making him do it , but eventually decided that he was n't worth the effort . Meanwhile , Doyle becomes increasingly abusive towards Karl and Frank , leading to an eventual drunken outburst and physical confrontation with Linda and Frank , angering the boy . Linda then kicks Doyle out of the house ( despite his threats to kill her if she ever left him ) . The next day , Linda and Doyle reconcile . Knowing that he has the upper hand again , Doyle confronts Karl and Frank and announces his plan to move into the house permanently ; he plans big changes including Karl s removal from the house . Karl begins to realize that , eventually , Frank is going to kill Doyle and end up just like him . In order to prevent this , Karl makes Frank promise to spend the night at Vaughan s house , and asks Vaughan to pick up Linda from work and have her stay over also . Karl returns to Linda s house , but seems undecided about whether to enter . When confronted , a drunk Doyle asks what Karl is doing with the lawnmower blade he had sharpened and fashioned into a weapon . Karl replies , I aim to kill you with it . Karl asks how to reach the police by phone , Doyle says Karl should dial 911 and request an ambulance , or a hearst ' . Karl kills Doyle with two chopping blows of the lawnmower blade to the head . Karl then calls the police to turn himself in , and requests a hearst be sent for Doyle . He eats biscuits while waiting for the police . Returned to the state hospital , he seems a different person than he was during his previous incarceration , having learned the value of sacrificing one s self to save others . He silences a sexual predator ( played by J. T. Walsh ) who had previously forced him to listen to tales of his horrible deeds .
