Two teenagers , Masami ( Hitomi Satō ) and Tomoko ( Yūko Takeuchi ) , talk about a videotape recorded by a boy in Izu which is fabled to bear a curse that kills the viewer seven days after watching . Tomoko reveals that a week ago , she and three of her friends watched a weird tape and received a call after watching . Tomoko is killed by an unseen force as Masami watches , horrified . Days later , Reiko Asakawa ( Nanako Matsushima ) , a reporter investigating the popularity of the video curse , discovers that her niece Tomoko , and her three other friends , mysteriously died at the same time , on the same night , with their faces twisted in fear . She also discovers that Masami became insane and is in a mental hospital . After stumbling upon Tomoko s photos from the past week , Reiko finds that the four teenagers stayed in a rental cabin in Izu . Reiko goes to Izu and arrives at the rented cabin , where she finds an unlabeled tape in the reception room of the teenagers ' rental cottage . Watching the tape , Reiko sees a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images . As soon as the tape is over , Reiko sees a mysterious reflection in the television and receives a phone call , with an unknown voice telling her seven days . Disturbed , she leaves the cabin . Reiko enlists the help of her ex-husband , Ryūji Takayama ( Hiroyuki Sanada ) . They take a picture of Reiko and find her face blurred in the photograph . Ryūji then watches the tape , against Reiko s objections . A day later , Reiko creates a copy for Ryūji for them to study . They find a hidden message embedded within the tape saying frolic in brine , goblins be thine . The message is in a form of dialect from Izu Ōshima Island . That night , Reiko catches her young son Yoichi watching the videotape ; claiming that Tomoko had told him to do it . Reiko and Ryūji sail for Ōshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura , who was accused of faking supernatural powers ; and thus committed suicide . With only a day left , Reiko and Ryūji discover that the videotape was made psionically by Shizuko s lost daughter , Sadako Yamamura , whose supernatural powers surpassed even those of her mother . The two go back to Izu with the assumption that Sadako is dead and her vengeful spirit ( Onryō ) killed the teenagers . They uncover a well underneath the cabin and through a vision see the circumstances of Sadako s murder by her father . They try to find Sadako s body in an attempt to appease her spirit . Minutes before her seven days are up , Reiko finds Sadako s corpse , and they believe that the curse is broken . The next day Ryūji is at home and his TV switches on by itself , showing the image of a well . The ghost of Sadako crawls out of the well , out of Ryūji s TV set , and frightens him into a state of shock , killing him via cardiac arrest . Before dying , he manages to dial Reiko s number ; she hears his last minutes over the phone and realizes the videotape s curse remains unbroken . Desperate to save her son , Reiko realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else saved her . With a VCR and Ryūji s copy of the tape , Reiko travels with her son to see her father in an attempt to save him , realizing that this is a never-ending cycle : The tape must always be copied and passed on to ensure the survival of the viewers .
