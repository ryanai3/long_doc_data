U.S. Navy SEAL Lieutenant Shane Wolfe is assigned to rescue Howard Plummer , a man working on a top-secret government project , from a group of Serbian rebels . Wolfe and his team manage to get Plummer off an enemy boat but are shot while boarding the escape helicopter . Plummer is killed in the attack , and Wolfe spends two months in the hospital . Wolfe s commanding officer , Captain Bill Fawcett , is assigned to escort Plummer s widow , Julie , to Zç«¯rich , where a safety deposit box belonging to the Plummers has been discovered . Wolfe is assigned to stay at the Plummer residence , in Bethesda , Maryland to search for the secret project called GHOST , as well as look after the family s five children : Zoe , Seth , Lulu , Peter , and Baby Tyler . The kids prove to be difficult to handle , even with the help of nanny Helga , who finally quits when one of Zoe and Seth s pranks intended for Wolfe goes wrong . A few days later , the school s vice principal , Duane Murney , informs Wolfe that Seth has cut and bleached his hair , has a Nazi armband in his locker , and has skipped every wrestling practice for the past month . At home , a furious Seth tells Wolfe that he only joined the wrestling team because his father wanted him to . He sneaks out of the house , tricking the alarm system with a refrigerator magnet . Wolfe leaves Zoe in charge and follows him to the town theater , where he learns that Seth has secretly joined an amateur production of The Sound of Music . The director quits when he believes the show will be a failure . Wolfe volunteers to take his place , and juggles this task with taking care of the house , giving Zoe driving lessons , and teaching Lulu and the Firefly Scouts martial arts to defend themselves against the rival boy scout troop . Seth quits the wrestling team , and Wolfe challenges Murney to a wrestling match in front of the entire school and easily wins despite Murney s show of bluster . The training Wolfe gives the Firefly Scouts becomes useful when they once again have a conflict with the thuggish scouts . Zoe and Wolfe share stories of their fathers , both of whom died in similar circumstances . They are interrupted by a phone call from Julie , who has figured out the password ( My Angel ) , retrieved the item in a box ( a special key ) , and is on her way home . The kids immediately begin to plan a Welcome Home ' party . That evening , Wolfe discovers a secret vault underneath the garage , which requires a key to open . When Fawcett and Julie arrive home , Fawcett and Wolfe go to the garage , where Wolfe says he is rethinking his career . Two ninjas arrive armed and pull off their masks , revealing themselves as the Plummers ' North Korean neighbors , the Chuns . Fawcett suddenly knocks out Wolfe , revealing himself to be a double agent . Mr. Chun restrains and guards the children while Fawcett and Mrs. Chun take Julie down to the vault . They manage to open the door , but a dangerous security system prevents them from going any farther . The children manage to escape and awaken Wolfe , who sends the kids to get the police while he goes to the vault to help Julie . Mr. Chun follows them in his car ; with Zoe at the wheel , the kids force him to crash . Wolfe figures out how to get past the security system , using a dance ( The Peter Panda Dance ) Howard had used to make Peter go to sleep each night . Julie knocks out Mrs. Chun , and Wolfe s voice activates the final vault , knocking out Fawcett with the door . By then , the children have lured a large crowd of police to the house . Mr. Chun arrives and holds all of them at gunpoint . Wolfe notices school principal and love interest Claire Fletcher ( Lauren Graham ) right behind him , having followed the chase when she saw it pass by the school . Wolfe distracts Mr. Chun with the aide of Gary the duck , and Claire knocks him unconscious . With the mission accomplished and Fawcett and the Chuns arrested , Wolfe and the Plummers say their goodbyes , and Wolfe and Claire share a kiss . At Seth s performance , it is revealed that Wolfe decided to retire from the Navy and join the school staff as the new wrestling coach . Murney also performs in the play , singing Climb Ev'ry Mountain off-key while dressed in a nun s habit .
