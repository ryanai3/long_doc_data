In a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999 , Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat . His companion Elaine becomes concerned and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935 , which took place when he was a prison officer , in charge of death row and the state s electric chair . In 1935 , Paul supervises fellow officers Brutus Brutal Howell , Dean Stanton , Harry Terwilliger and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary on what they refer to as the Green Mile , Death Row . Paul , suffering from a severe bladder infection , receives a physically imposing , but mentally challenged , black man , John Coffey , into his custody ; John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls . One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck , who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed . Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak , but is beyond reproach ; he is the nephew of Louisiana s First Lady , but only Paul is bold enough to defy this . He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Del Delacroix ; he breaks Del s fingers with his baton , steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles , which Del had adopted , repeatedly calls him by a gay slur , and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del s head ; Del s body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain . John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers ; he cures Paul s bladder infection , resurrects Mr. Jingles , and heals Melinda Moores , wife of the prison s chief warden , of a brain tumor . This last affliction he releases into Percy , who under its influence shoots another prisoner , mass murderer William Wharton , dead . Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker ; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block , made mischief on two occasions later which caused Paul to order him restrained in the block s padded cell , groped Percy briefly , racially insulted John , and revealed psychically to John that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which John was unjustly condemned . John then reveals the story psychically to Paul , but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into Paul . Percy , meanwhile , is committed to the insane asylum which , ironically , Wharton had come from , and where he , Percy , was hopeful of getting a job . John tells Paul , distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man , that he does in fact wish to die , as he views the world as a cruel place . Mentioning that he had never before seen a movie , John watches Top Hat with the other guards as a last request . That night , John is executed , although he refuses the customary hood , as he is afraid of the dark . Paul concludes his story by telling Elaine that John s was the last execution that either he or Brutus supervised ; following Coffey s execution they both took jobs in the juvenile system . Elaine realizes that , since he had a grown son in 1935 , Paul must be much older than he looks . Paul reveals that he is , in fact , 108 years of age , and not only is he still alive , so is Mr. Jingles , Del s mouse . Paul then muses that if John s power could make a mouse live for as long as Mr. Jingles has , how much longer does he himself have left ?
