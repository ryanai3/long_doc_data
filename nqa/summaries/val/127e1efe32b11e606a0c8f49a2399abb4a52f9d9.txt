In 1585 , Catholic Spain ruled by King Philip II of Spain ( Jordi Molla ) is the most powerful country in the world . Seeing Protestant England as a threat , and in retaliation for English piracy of Spanish ships , Philip declares war . He plans to take over England and make his daughter , Isabella , the Queen of England in Elizabeth s place . Meanwhile , Elizabeth I of England ( Cate Blanchett ) is being pressured by her advisor , Francis Walsingham ( Geoffrey Rush ) , to marry , for if she dies without an heir , the throne will pass to her cousin , Mary , Queen of Scots ( Samantha Morton ) , who is Catholic . Therefore , the Queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors , particularly the very youthful Charles II , Archduke of Austria ( Christian Brassington ) , who has become infatuated with the her . However , she refuses to marry any of them . English explorer Walter Raleigh ( Clive Owen ) is presented at Elizabeth s court , having returned from the New World , and he offers her potatoes , tobacco , two Native Americans , and gold from a Spanish ship that he claims was unable to continue its journey . Elizabeth commands that the Native Americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold . Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh , enthralled by his tales of exploration , and asks Bess Throckmorton ( Abbie Cornish ) , her most favored lady-in-waiting , to observe him . Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him . Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer , Dr. John Dee ( David Threlfall ) , who predicts that two empires will go to war . However , he can not predict which will triumph over the other , leaving Elizabeth to ponder her and England s fate . Jesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary , in what Philip calls The English Enterprise , historically known as the Babington Plot . From her imprisonment , Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits , who recruit Anthony Babington ( Eddie Redmayne ) to assassinate Elizabeth . Walsingham continues to warn Elizabeth of Spain s rising power and of the Catholics ' plots against her . However she , unlike her predecessor and half-sister Mary I of England , refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs . Even so , those conspiring against Elizabeth are being hunted and murdered , including Bess s cousin , Sir Francis Throckmorton and his father , whom Bess had failed to protect . After learning of her cousin s torture and death at Walsingham s hands , Bess turns to Raleigh for comfort . Walsingham s brother , a Papist , who knows of the plot against Elizabeth is jailed . Walsingham reveals Spain s plot to Elizabeth , who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats . The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance , accuses Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates , and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh . In response , a sword fight nearly ensues between the Queen s male escorts and the Spanish contingent , and Elizabeth throws the Spaniards out of court . Meanwhile , Philip is cutting down the forests of Spain to build the Spanish Armada , to invade England . Mary writes letters condoning the plot . Babington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her . Elizabeth opens her arms , seemingly fearless . He pulls the trigger , and the gun fires . At first Walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless , though it is later revealed by the traitor , in the torture chamber , that there was no bullet in the gun . Elizabeth learns of Mary s involvement in the plot , and Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt . Elizabeth is reluctant , but nevertheless agrees . Mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded , after ascending the block in a blood-red dress ( red being the Catholic liturgical color for martyrs ) . Walsingham sees that this was part of the Jesuits ' plan all along . Philip had never intended Mary to become queen , but since the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarded Mary as the true Queen of England , Philip uses Mary s death to obtain papal approval for war . The murder of the last legitimate Catholic in the line of succession gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch , and he oversees the departure of the Armada from Cรกdiz . In England , Raleigh asks to leave for the New World , which Elizabeth forbids , instead knighting him and making him Captain of the Royal Guard . Bess discovers she is pregnant with Raleigh s child , and after telling him the news , she pleads with him to leave . He chooses not to , and the couple marries in secret . Elizabeth confronts Bess a few weeks later ; Bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with Raleigh s child , and that Raleigh is her husband . An enraged Elizabeth berates Bess , reminding her that she can not marry without royal consent . Feeling betrayed , the queen banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen . Walsingham arranges for his brother William to be released and taken to France , on the condition that he must never return to England . The Armada begins its approach up the English Channel , and Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join Sir Francis Drake in the battle . Elizabeth gives her Speech to the Troops at Tilbury , while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour . The ships of the Armada vastly outnumber England s , but at the last moment , a major storm blows the Armada toward the beaches , endangering its formation and ships . The ships of the Armada drop anchor , and the Armada becomes a sitting duck for English fire ships . Elizabeth , back at her coastal headquarters , walks out to the cliffs and watches the Spanish Armada sink in flames . Elizabeth visits Walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest . She then visits Raleigh and Bess and blesses their child . Elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal , again resigned to her role as the Virgin Queen and mother to the English people .
