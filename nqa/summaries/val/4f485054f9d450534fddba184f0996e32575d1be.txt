Convenience store robber Herbert I . Hi McDunnough ( Nicolas Cage ) and police officer Edwina Ed ( Holly Hunter ) meet after she takes the mugshots of the recidivist . With continued visits , Hi learns that Ed s fiancĂŠ has left her . Hi proposes to her after his latest release from prison , and the two get married . They move into a desert mobile home , and Hi gets a job in a machine shop . They want to have children but Ed is infertile , and they can not adopt because of Hi s criminal record , despite the fact that Ed is a police officer . Devastated , Ed resigns her job . The couple learns of the Arizona Quints , sons of locally famous furniture magnate Nathan Arizona ( Trey Wilson ) ; Hi and Ed kidnap one of the five babies , whom they believe to be Nathan Junior . Hi and Ed return home and are soon visited by Hi s cellmates , Gale and Evelle Snoats ( John Goodman and William Forsythe ) , who have just escaped from prison . Under the brothers ' influence , Hi is tempted to return to his felonious ways . Their problems get worse when Hi s supervisor , Glen ( Sam McMurray ) , proposes wife swapping and Hi assaults him . That night , Hi decides to steal a package of diapers for the baby , but gets carried away and starts to rob the convenience store . Ed sees this and , furious , drives off without him . Hi is then forced to flee on foot from the convenience store , chased by two police officers and an armed cashier , who attempt to shoot him down , as well as a pack of neighborhood dogs , but he manages to outrun and lose them . Ed eventually picks him up , leading to a tense ride home . At the McDunnough residence the next day , Glen approaches Hi to fire him , and reveals that he has deduced Junior s identity because of the newspaper article he read about Junior missing , and blackmails Hi , threatening to turn him over to the police unless Glen and Dot get custody of Junior . Gale and Evelle overhear this conversation and turn on Hi , tying him to a chair and taking Junior for themselves . Gale and Evelle leave with plans to rob a hayseed bank with Junior in tow . When Ed comes home , she frees Hi and the two arm themselves and set out together to retrieve the child . En route , Ed suggests that they should end their marriage after recovering the boy . Meanwhile , Nathan Arizona Sr. is approached by the bounty hunter Leonard Smalls ( Randall Tex Cobb ) who offers to find the child for $ 50,000 . Nathan Sr. declines the offer , believing that Smalls himself is his son s kidnapper . Smalls decides to recover the child anyway to sell on the black market . He begins tracking Gale and Evelle and learns of their bank robbery plans . Gale and Evelle rob a bank but leave Junior there as they make their getaway . One of the bank s anti-theft dye canisters explodes in their loot sack , blocking the car s windows and incapacitating them . At the bank , Smalls arrives for Junior just ahead of Ed and Hi . Ed grabs the baby and flees ; Hi is able to fend Smalls off for a while , but eventually finds himself at Smalls ' mercy when Smalls punches Hi in the face several times . As Smalls throws Hi to the ground and prepares to kill him , Hi holds up his hand to reveal that he has pulled the pin from one of the hand grenades on Smalls ' vest . Smalls attempts to get rid of the grenade , but he can not get it off in time and is blown to pieces when the grenade explodes and sets off all his weapons . Hi and Ed sneak Junior back into the Arizona home and are confronted by Nathan Sr. After Nathan Sr. learns why they took his son , he understands the couple s predicament and decides not to turn them over to the police . He counsels them : when Hi and Ed say that they are splitting up , he advises them to sleep on it . Hi and Ed go to sleep in the same bed , and Hi has a dream about Gale and Evelle reforming after returning to prison ; Glen gets his due from a Polish-American police officer after telling one Polack joke too many ; and Nathan Jr. gets a football for Christmas from a kindly couple who wish to remain unknown , later becoming a football star . The dream ends with an elderly couple ( implied to be Hi and Ed ) together enjoying a holiday visit from a large family of children and grandchildren .
