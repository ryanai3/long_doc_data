In 1910 , the last year of Leo Tolstoy s life , his disciples , led by Vladimir Chertkov , manoeuvre against his wife , Sofya , for control over Tolstoy s works after his death . The main setting is the Tolstoy country estate of Yasnaya Polyana . Tolstoy and Sofya have had a long , passionate marriage , but his spiritual ideals and asceticism ( he is opposed , for example , to private property ) are at odds with her more aristocratic and conventionally religious views . Contention focuses on a new will that the Tolstoians are attempting to persuade him to sign . It would place all of his copyrights into the public domain , supposedly leaving his family without adequate support . The maneuvering is seen through the eyes of Tolstoy s new secretary , Valentin Bulgakov , who finds himself mediating between the two sides . He also has a love affair with one of the Tolstoians , Masha . Ultimately , Tolstoy signs the new will and travels to an undisclosed location where he can continue his work undisturbed . After his departure , Sofya unsuccessfully attempts suicide . During the journey , Tolstoy falls ill . The film ends with his death near the Astapovo train station where Sofya is allowed by their daughter to see him just moments before his death . The closing credits state that five years after his death the Russian senate reverted the copyrights of Tolstoy s work to Sofya .
