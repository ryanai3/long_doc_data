In 1815 , French prisoner Jean Valjean is released on parole from Toulon prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and trying to escape multiple times . On the outside , Valjean’s paroled status prevents him from getting work . He is offered shelter by the kindly Bishop of Digne , but Valjean steals his silverware . Captured by police and taken to the Bishop , Valjean is shocked when the Bishop says he gave him the silver , telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life . Valjean breaks his parole to start a new life . Eight years later , Valjean is factory owner and mayor of Montreuil , Pas-de-Calais . He is shocked when a Toulon prison guard Javert arrives as his new chief of police . Javert suspects Valjean’s identity when he rescues an injured worker trapped under a heavy cart . One of Valjean’s workers , Fantine , is dismissed by the factory foreman upon learning she is sending her earnings to her illegitimate daughter Cosette , who lives with the greedy innkeepers , the Thénardiers . To support her daughter , Fantine becomes a prostitute but is arrested by Javert when she attacks an abusive customer . Valjean , learning who she is , has her hospitalised . Valjean learns a man has been wrongly identified as him , and reveals his true identity to a court before returning to the dying Fantine , promising to care for Cosette . Javert arrives but Valjean escapes , finding Cosette and pays Fantine’s debts to the Thénardiers . Valjean and Cosette flee Javert , hiding in a convent , aided by the worker Valjean rescued before . Nine years later , Valjean has become a philanthropist and helps the poor in Paris . General Lamarque , the only government official sympathetic to the poor , dies , and a group of revolutionists called the Friends of the ABC plot to rebel against the monarchy . Marius Pontmercy , a member of the Friends , encounters Cosette and they fall in love , asking Éponine , the Thénardiers’ daughter to help find her . After Marius and Cosette meet and confess their love , Éponine prevents her father from robbing Valjean’s house . Valjean , believing Javert is near , makes plans to flee to England with Cosette . Cosette writes a letter for Marius , but Éponine hides it , intending on dying with Marius during the rebellion . During Lamarque’s funeral procession , the revolt begins and barricades are built across Paris . Javert pretends to be an ally to spy on the rebels but the street urchin Gavroche exposes him as a policeman . During the first skirmish against the soldiers , Éponine takes a bullet for Marius and dies in his arms , giving him Cosette’s letter and confesses to him beforehand . Gavroche takes Marius’ reply to Valjean , who joins the revolution to guard Marius . Valjean offers to execute Javert but actually releases him , faking his death . By dawn , the soldiers are close to ending the revolution , storming the students’ barricade and killing everyone save Marius and Valjean , who escape into the sewers . Thénardier comes across Valjean and the unconscious Marius , stealing the latter’s ring , before pointing a way out . Valjean finds Javert waiting for him , ignoring his nemesis’ threats . Javert , morally confused by the mercy of Valjean , commits suicide by throwing himself in the Seine . Marius recovers but is traumatised by the death of his friends . Marius and Cosette plan to marry but Valjean , concerned his presence would threaten their happiness , makes plans to leave and reveals his identity to Marius , who promises to remain silent . Cosette and Marius marry but the Thénardiers crash the wedding to try and blackmail Marius , Thénardier saying he witnessed Valjean carrying a murdered corpse and produces the stolen ring . Marius assaults Thénardier who reveals Valjean is at the convent . The dying Valjean reunites with Cosette and Marius , giving them letters of confession , before peacefully dying , guided away by Fantine and the Bishop’s spirits .
