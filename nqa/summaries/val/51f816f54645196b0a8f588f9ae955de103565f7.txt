Architect Peter Mitchell ( Tom Selleck ) , cartoonist Michael Kellam ( Steve Guttenberg ) , and actor Jack Holden ( Ted Danson ) are happy living their lives as bachelors in their lofty New York City apartment where they have frequent parties and flings with different women . Their lives are disrupted when a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep one day . A note with her , written by a lady named Sylvia , indicates that she is Jack s , the result of a tryst between the actor and actress . Mary arrives in his absence â he is in Turkey shooting a B movie , leaving Peter and Michael to fend for themselves in taking care of her . Prior to leaving , Jack had made arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment as a favor . Before Mary s arrival , he calls and leaves a message with Peter and Michael informing them of it and to keep it a secret per the director friend s wishes . When she arrives , they mistakenly believe she is the package , even though there is a note from her mother . Peter and Michael are totally befuddled on how to care for Mary , and Peter leaves to go buy whatever supplies are needed . While he is gone , Mrs. Hathaway ( Cynthia Harris ) , the landlady , delivers a small box ( which is the actual package containing heroin ) to the apartment and Michael tosses it aside while trying to keep Mary under control . After Peter returns , they eventually figure out her proper care , right down to diaper changes , baths , and feedings . The next day , two men ( who are drug dealers ) arrive at the apartment to pick up the package . Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to them instead , and shortly after they leave , Peter discovers the actual package . He runs downstairs to intercept them , but trips and stumbles , and the package s contents spill . He gathers it and retrieves Mary from them , but retains the heroin while allowing them to take a can of powdered milk . After the exchange , a police officer attempts to ticket them for illegal parking , but they escape . He accosts Peter and detains him in the apartment until Sgt . Melkowitz ( Philip Bosco ) , a narcotics officer , arrives to question him and Michael about the drugs . They successfully hide them from him during the interrogation , in which they learn that Jack s friend is a drug dealer as well . He leaves with suspicions and puts them and the apartment under surveillance . Peter and Michael are able to persuade Mrs. Hathaway to babysit Mary while they work . Once they get home , however , they find her bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked , apparently by the dealers demanding the heroin . Mary is safe , however . They continue with their care of her , adjusting to surrogate fatherhood and growing attached to her , until Jack returns . Once Jack returns , Peter and Michael question him about the entire drug deal and Mary . He replies that he knew nothing about the heroin and initially denies everything about Mary until he reads the note from Sylvia . He then recalls the tryst that eventually led to her being born . Peter and Michael do not hesitate in taking their revenge and passing all responsibility of looking after her to him , but he quickly grows to love her . Later , Peter discovers in the mail a news clipping of Jack s director friend being hospitalized after a mugging ( presumably by the drug dealers ) , with a handwritten note , Do n't let this happen to you . They formulate a plan to meet and trap them when they negotiate a deal to deliver the illicit goods . With a recording of the conversation , they prove their innocence to Melkowitz and the dealers are arrested . By now , they have fully embraced their role as Mary s guardians . However , one morning , Sylvia ( Nancy Travis ) arrives , asking for her back intending to take her to London to live with her family . Handing her over , they quickly find themselves miserable and desperately missing her . Deciding to stop her and Sylvia from leaving , they rush to the airport to try and persuade the latter to stay , but they arrive just as her plane is backing up from the gate . Defeated , they return home , where they find both Mary and Sylvia , who did not go to London after all . Sylvia tearfully explains she does n't want to give up her acting career but ca n't do so if she has to raise Mary alone , so Peter quickly invites her and Mary to move in with them with Jack and Michael s agreement , and she agrees .
