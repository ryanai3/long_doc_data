An apparition of Elvis appears to Clarence and convinces him to kill Alabama s pimp Drexl . Clarence goes to the brothel where Alabama had worked , shoots and kills Drexl , and takes a bag he assumes contains Alabama s belongings . Back at the apartment , he and Alabama discover the bag contains a large amount of cocaine . The couple visit Clarence s estranged father , Clifford , a former cop and now a security guard , for help . Clifford tells Clarence that the police assume Drexl s murder to be a gang killing . After the couple leave for Los Angeles , Clifford is interrogated by Don Vincenzo Coccotti , consigliere to a mobster named Blue Lou Boyle , who wants the drugs . Clifford , realizing he will die anyway , mockingly defies Coccotti , whereupon Coccotti angrily shoots Clifford dead . A note on the refrigerator leads the mobsters to Clarence s L.A. address . In L.A. , Clarence and Alabama meet Clarence s old friend Dick , an aspiring actor .
