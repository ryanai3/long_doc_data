Lilly Dillon ( Angelica Huston ) is a veteran con artist . She works for a bookmaker , Bobo Justus ( Pat Hingle ) , making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots . On her way to La Jolla for the horse races , she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy ( John Cusack ) , a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years . She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach . When medical assistance finally comes , Lilly confronts the doctor , threatening to have him killed if her son dies . At the hospital , Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy s girlfriend , Myra Langtry ( Annette Bening ) , who is a few years older than her son . Lilly urges her son to quit the grift , saying he literally does not have the stomach for it . Because she leaves late for La Jolla , she misses a race where the winner was paying 70â1 . For this mistake , Bobo burns her hand with a cigar . Myra , like Roy and Lilly , plays all the angles . When her landlord demands payment of late rent , she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent . She makes a similar offer to a jeweler ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn . Upon leaving the hospital , Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend . On the train , she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game . Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long-con operation . Myra describes her long association with another man , Cole ( J. T. Walsh ) , and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons , including a greedy oil investor , Gloucester Hebbing ( Charles Napier ) . A flashback scene in a plush office building culminates in a fake FBI raid with a fake shooting of Myra to discourage Hebbing from going to the police . Roy , who insists on working only short-term cons , resists the proposition , fearing she may try to dupe him herself . Myra , seeing Lilly s power over Roy , accuses him of having an incestuous interest in Lilly . Infuriated , Roy strikes her . Myra then plans her revenge . She lets it be known that Lilly has been stealing from Bobo over the years and stashing money in the trunk of her car . Lilly is warned by a friend and flees . Myra follows with the intention of killing her . Roy is called by an FBI agent to identify his mother s body , found in a motel room with the face disfigured by a gunshot wound . While identifying it as Lilly s , he silently notes that there is no cigar burn on the corpse s hand . Coming back home , he finds Lilly trying to steal all of his money . Lilly reveals that she shot Myra in self-defense at the motel and arranged the scene to appear as though Myra s body was actually Lilly s . Roy refuses to let Lilly depart with his money . Lilly pleads with him , then attempts to seduce him , even going so far as to tempt Roy by claiming he is not really her son . Roy rejects her , disgusted . Angered , Lilly swings a suitcase at him and unintentionally breaks a glass he was drinking from into his neck , slashing an artery . Lilly sobs convulsively while she packs up the money as her son bleeds to death on the floor . In the penultimate shot , she is seen dressed in red , riding an elevator that is heading down . Then she gets into Roy s car and drives off into the night .
