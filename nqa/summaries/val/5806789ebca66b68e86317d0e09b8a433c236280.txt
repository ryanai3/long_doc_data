Disillusioned knight Antonius Block ( Max von Sydow ) and his nihilistic squire Jöns ( Gunnar Björnstrand ) return after fighting in the Crusades and find Sweden being ravaged by the plague . On the beach immediately after their arrival , the knight encounters Death ( Bengt Ekerot ) , personified as a pale , black-cowled figure resembling a monk . The knight , in the middle of a chess game he has been playing alone , challenges Death to a chess match , believing that he can forestall his demise as long as the game continues . Death agrees , and they start a new game . The other characters in the story , except for Jof in the end , do not see Death , and when the chess board comes out at various times in the story , they believe the knight is continuing his habit of playing alone . The knight with his squire heads for his castle . Along the way , they pass some actors , Jof ( Nils Poppe ) and his wife Mia ( Bibi Andersson ) , with their infant son , Mikael , and their actor-manager , Skat ( Erik Strandmark ) . Jof is also a juggler and has visions of Jesus and Mary , but Mia is skeptical of them . The knight and squire enter a church where a fresco of the Dance of Death is being painted . The squire draws a small figure representing himself . The knight goes to the confessional where he is joined by Death in the robe of a priest , to whom he admits that his life has been futile and without meaning , but that he wants to perform one meaningful deed . Upon revealing the chess strategy that will save his life , the knight discovers that the priest is Death , who promises to remember the tactics . Leaving the church , the knight speaks to a young woman ( Maud Hansson ) who has been condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil . Shortly thereafter , the squire searches an abandoned village for water . He saves a servant girl ( Gunnel Lindblom ) from being raped by a man robbing a corpse . He recognizes the man as Raval ( Bertil Anderberg ) , a theologian , who 10 years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land . The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again . The servant girl joins the squire . The trio ride into town , where the actors met earlier are performing . The actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd , then is enticed by Lisa ( Inga Gill ) , the blacksmith s wife , away for a tryst . They run off together . The actors performance is interrupted by the arrival of a procession of flagellants . At a public house , the juggler meets Raval who forces him to dance on the tables like a bear . The squire appears and , true to his word , slices the theologian s face . The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by the wife of the juggler . The knight says : I ll carry this memory between my hands as if it were bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk ... And it will be an adequate sign – it will be enough for me . He invites the actors to his castle , where they will be safer from the plague . Along the way , they come across the actor-manager and the blacksmith s wife in the forest . Dissatisfied with him , she returns to her husband . After the others leave , the actor-manager climbs a tree for the night . Death cuts down the tree , informing the actor that his time is up . They pass the condemned young woman again . The knight asks the woman again to summon Satan , so he can ask him about God . The girl claims already to have done so , but the knight can not see him , only her terror . He gives her herbs to take away her pain . The theologian reappears . Dying of the plague , he pleads for water . The servant girl attempts to bring him some , but the squire stops her . The juggler tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with Death , and decides to flee with his family while Death is preoccupied . After hearing Death state No one escapes me the knight knocks the chess pieces over , distracting Death while the family slips away . Death places the pieces back on the board , then wins the game on the next move . He announces that when they meet again , the knight s time—and that of all those traveling with him—will be up . Before departing , Death asks if the knight has accomplished his one meaningful deed yet ; The Knight replies that he has . The knight is reunited with his wife , Karin ( Inga Landgré ) , the sole occupant of his castle , all the servants having fled . The party shares one last supper before Death comes for them . The knight prays to God , Have mercy on us , because we are small and frightened and ignorant . Meanwhile , the little family sits out a storm , which the juggler interprets to be the Angel of Death and he s very big . The next morning , the juggler , with his second sight , sees the knight and his followers being led away over the hills in a solemn dance of death .
