After saving New York City from the demi-god Gozer , the GhostbustersâPeter Venkman , Egon Spengler , Ray Stantz , and Winston Zeddemoreâwere sued by several city and state agencies for the property damage . Rather than face financial ruin , they accepted a restraining order barring them from operating as paranormal investigators and eliminatorsâforcing them out of business . In the eyes of the city , they are now considered frauds . Five years later , Ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children s entertainer with Winston ; Egon has returned to Columbia University to conduct experiments into human emotion ; and Peter hosts a pseudo-psychic television show . Peter s former girlfriend Dana Barrett has had a son , Oscar , with a violinist whom she married then divorced when he received an offer to join the London Symphony Orchestra . In order to take care of her baby , Dana quit performing and now works as a restorer at the fictional Manhattan Museum of Art , working to prepare a malevolent-looking portrait of a legendary sixteenth-century tyrant named Vigo the Carpathian of Moldavia for an upcoming exhibition . After an incident in which Oscar s baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy intersection , Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help . Meanwhile , Dana s colleague Dr. Janosz Poha has become increasingly obsessed with the glowering image of Vigo in the painting and falls under its spell . Vigo , whose spirit inhabits the painting , orders Janosz to locate a child that he can possess , allowing him to return to life on the New Year . Janosz , infatuated with Dana , offers to bring baby Oscar to Vigo in exchange for Dana , a deal which Vigo accepts . The Ghostbusters ' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped . Lowered underneath , Ray discovers a vast river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line . Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample , Ray causes a city-wide blackout by accidentally kicking a cast iron pipe that breaks , falls , and shorts out an electric cable . After this , the Ghostbusters are arrested by the NYPD . Ineffectually defended by Louis Tully , they are found guilty of violating the restraining order by Judge Wexler , aka The Hammer . Before they are taken to Riker s Island , Wexler angrily berates them . In response , the slime recovered by Ray and taken as evidence explodes , releasing the ghosts of two murderers that the judge had condemned to death that proceed to devastate the courtroom . The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in return for the cancellation of the restraining order . Later , the slime invades Dana s apartment via the bathtub and attacks her and Oscar . She seeks refuge with Peter , and the two begin to renew their relationship . Investigating the psychomagnatheric ' slime and Vigo s history , the Ghostbusters discover that it reacts to emotions ; it can be charged positively or negatively . They suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of New Yorkers . While Peter and Dana have dinner together , Egon , Ray , and Winston explore the underground river of slime . While measuring its depth , Winston gets pulled into the slime flow , and Ray and Egon jump in after him . After they escape back to the surface Ray and Winston begin an angry argument , but Egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime , so they strip off their clothes . They also learn the river is flowing underground directly to the museum where Dana works . The Ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions , but are dismissed ; the mayor s assistant , Jack Hardemeyer , has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor s campaign for governor . Meanwhile , a spirit resembling Janosz as a nanny kidnaps Oscar from Peter s apartment , and Dana pursues them to the museum alone . After she enters , the museum is covered with a cocoon of impenetrable slime . New Year s Eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets , causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens . In response , the mayor fires Hardemeyer and has the Ghostbusters released . After heading to the museum , they are unable to breach the slime barrier with their proton packs . Determining that they need a powerful symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime , the Ghostbusters use positively charged mood slime and a remix of Higher and Higher to animate the Statue of Liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering crowds . As they arrive at the museum , the slime begins to recede and they use the Statue s flaming torch to break through a skylight to attack Vigo and Janosz . Janosz is neutralized with positively charged mood slime , but Vigo immobilizes the Ghostbusters and attempts to transfer into Oscar s body . The positive feelings accompanying a chorus of Auld Lang Syne by the citizens outside weakens Vigo , returning him to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters . Vigo momentarily possesses Ray , and the other Ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively charged mood slime . This destroys Vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four Ghostbusters standing protectively around Oscar . Outside , the Ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and , at a later ceremony to restore the Statue , the Key to the City from the mayor .
