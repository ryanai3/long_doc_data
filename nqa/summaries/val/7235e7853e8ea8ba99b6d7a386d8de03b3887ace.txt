In an upscale New York City mansion , wealthy and popular teenager Kathryn Merteuil ( Gellar ) is discussing her prep school with Mrs. Caldwell ( Christine Baranski ) and Mrs. Caldwell s daughter Cecile ( Selma Blair ) . Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the sheltered and naèª°ve Cecile . Kathryn s step-brother Sebastian ( Phillippe ) enters the room , whereupon Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile . Kathryn reveals to him that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds , who had dumped her for Cecile . Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile ; he refuses as he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove ( Witherspoon ) , the virgin daughter of their school s new headmaster . Annette is a paradigm of chastity and virtue ' who recently wrote a published essay about saving herself for marriage and has been temporarily staying with Sebastian s aunt . The two make a wager : if Sebastian fails to bed Annette , Kathryn gets Sebastian s vintage Jaguar XK140 ; if he succeeds , Kathryn will have sex with him . It is mentioned that Sebastian keeps a journal detailing his conquests . Sebastian s first attempt to seduce Annette fails , as she had already been told of his reputation as a womanizer . He vents to his friend , Blaine Tuttle ( Joshua Jackson ) . Blaine suggests that the informant might be Annette s ex-boyfriend and closeted jock , Greg McConnell ( Eric Mabius ) , revealing to Sebastian that Greg tried to make a pass at him . He uses that to seduce Greg while being secretly filmed by Sebastian . Sebastian confronts Greg with the photographs , but he denies warning Annette . Greg is pressured into investigating who did , and Sebastian also orders him to present him in a good light to Annette . Later , while gushing about Sebastian to Annette , Greg discovers that the culprit is Cecile s mother , Mrs. Caldwell . Wanting revenge on the Caldwells , Sebastian agrees to seduce Cecile . Meanwhile , Cecile s music teacher , Ronald Clifford ( Sean Patrick Thomas ) , is in love with her . Cecile confesses this to Kathryn . Kathryn tells Mrs. Caldwell about Ronald and Cecile s romance and Mrs. Caldwell orders Cecile to end it . Sebastian , in turn , calls Cecile to his house , ostensibly to give her a letter from Ronald . There he blackmails Cecile in order to perform oral sex on her . The next day , Cecile confides in Kathryn , who advises her to learn from Sebastian so that she can make Ronald happy in bed . Sebastian begins to fall in love with Annette , who returns his feelings but still resists him . Sebastian calls her a hypocrite because she claims to be waiting for her one true love , but when her one true love chooses to love her back , she resists . She relents , but Sebastian refuses her , confused about his feelings colliding with his stolid sexuality . Annette flees to the estate of her friend s parents . Sebastian tracks her down , professes his love , and makes love to her . As he has won the bet , Kathryn offers herself to Sebastian the next day , but he refuses ; he now only wants Annette . Kathryn taunts him and threatens to ruin Annette s reputation , so Sebastian pretends indifference to Annette and coldly breaks up with her . After Sebastian tells Kathryn that he has broken up with Annette and arranged for Cecile and Ronald to be together , Kathryn reveals that she has known all along that he was truly in love with Annette and manipulated him into giving her up . Sebastian angrily dismisses Kathryn , saying he no longer wants her , and she then rejects him . Sebastian leaves to confront Annette , and Kathryn calls Ronald , telling him that Sebastian slept with Cecile and lying to him that Sebastian hit her . Annette refuses Sebastian s apologies ; he sends her his journal , in which he has detailed all of Kathryn s manipulative schemes as well as their bet , and written the true feelings he had for Annette all along . As he heads home , Ronald intercepts him on the street , starting a fight . Annette runs out and tries to stop it , but is accidentally thrown into the way of traffic . Sebastian pushes her to safety , and is hit by a cab . Before he dies , Sebastian and Annette profess their love for each other . Watching this , Ronald realizes that Kathryn lied to him and used him to hurt Sebastian . At Sebastian s funeral , Cecile distributes copies of his journal , made into a book by Annette , titled Cruel Intentions . Kathryn is humiliated and rejected by her former friends , and her reputation is ruined when cocaine is discovered in her rosary . In the final scene , Annette drives away in Sebastian s car with his journal at her side as she remembers the moments they shared .
