The loss is particularly hard on Kate , who is also recovering from alcoholism . The couple decides to adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl named Esther ( Isabelle Fuhrman ) from a local orphanage . While Kate and John s deaf daughter Max ( Aryana Engineer ) embraces Esther immediately , their son Daniel ( Jimmy Bennett ) is less welcoming . Kate suspects that there might be problems in Esther s background when Esther s knowledge of sex extends beyond her age . Her suspicions deepen when Esther injures another girl who had bullied her at school . Kate is further alarmed when Sister Abigail ( C. C. H. Pounder ) , the head of the orphanage , warns her that bad things happen when Esther is around . Esther overhears this and plots to use Max to distract Sister Abigail and then kill her . Esther pushes Max into the path of Sister Abigail s car , forcing her to swerve off the road . Esther then kills Sister Abigail with a hammer , and forces Max to help her hide the weapon in their tree house . Kate is convinced that something is very wrong with Esther , but John does not believe her . Kate finds Esther s hidden Bible and discovers that it came from the Saarne Institute in Estonia , a mental hospital . She emails a picture of Esther to them and asks for more information . When Daniel learns about Sister Abigail s death , he tells Max of his plan to retrieve the hammer to prove Esther s guilt . Esther overhears this and confronts Daniel at the tree house , then sets it ablaze to kill him and destroy the evidence . Daniel falls from the tree trying to escape , and is knocked unconscious . Esther attempts to finish him off , but Max stops her . While Daniel is hospitalized , Esther slips into his room and smothers him with a pillow , stopping his heart ; doctors quickly revive him . Kate realizes what happened and attacks Esther but is restrained and sedated . That night , a provocatively-dressed Esther tries to seduce a drunken John , who finally realizes Kate was right . He tells Esther that her future with the Coleman s is at stake , upsetting her . Kate receives a call from Dr. Vì±„rava ( Karel Roden ) , the director of the Saarne Institute , who reveals that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer , who has hypopituitarism , a hormone disorder that stunted her physical growth , and that she has spent most of her life posing as a little girl and had people adopt her , with the goal of seducing the father and having a sexual relationship with him . The doctor reports that Leena has murdered at least seven people . The previous family she was adopted by was killed by her because the father had rejected her sexual advances .
