With supplies of petroleum nearly exhausted in the near future following a major energy crisis and a global nuclear war , ex-Main Force Patrol officer Mad Max Rockatansky ( Mel Gibson ) roams the now-depopulated and desolate desert in his scarred , black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special several years after the events of the first film , scavenging for food , water , and fuel . His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm — a sawn-off shotgun — for which ammunition is very scarce . While trying to escape a group of gang members – led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez ( Vernon Wells ) - Max manages to crash two of the gang member s vehicles and injure Wez ; recognising his defeat , Wez flees . After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi , Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel . Its pilot , the Gyro Captain ( Bruce Spence ) , ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered . In exchange for his own life , the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby . Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes . The gang leader , known as Lord Humungus ( Kjell Nilsson ) , tries to convince the refinery s defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area . A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound , but the marauders capture , torture , and kill all but one of them , who is rescued by Max . Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor : he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel . The man dies shortly after they enter the facility , and the facility leader , Pappagallo ( Michael Preston ) , reneges on the deal , saying it died when the survivor died . His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return , and Humungus repeats his offer . When the Feral Kid ( Emil Minty ) kills Wez s male companion , Wez becomes enraged , urging his leader to take the compound ; Humungus wrestles Wez into submission , but placates Wez by revealing he has no intention of letting any of the settlers leave . Max offers Pappagallo a different deal : he will retrieve the abandoned Mack semi-truck , which is capable of hauling the tanker trailer that the facility inhabitants use to store the fuel they refine , in exchange for freedom , his vehicle , and as much fuel as he can take with him . The group accepts , but keeps Max s car to ensure his co-operation . Max sneaks out , locating the Gyro Captain ( dragging the branch he is chained to ) and conscripts him to help find the truck using his gyrocopter . After finding the truck , Max drives it back to the compound , evading Humungus s men . The defenders want Max to escape with the group , but Max opts to collect his petrol and leave . However , his attempt to break through the siege fails : Wez gives chase in Humungus s nitrous oxide-equipped car and runs Max off the road , wrecking his vehicle and severely injuring him . The marauders kill Max s dog with a crossbow , then attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special s tanks , but trigger an explosive booby trap , which kills some of the attackers . Left for dead , Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain as he is trying to crawl back to the refinery . With no other means of escape and with the refinery s defenders preparing to depart , Max insists on driving the repaired truck . He leaves the compound in the heavily-armoured truck , accompanied by the Feral Kid he has befriended and by other inhabitants aboard as defenders . Pappagallo escorts him out in a captured marauder vehicle . Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker , leaving the remaining inhabitants free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan and buses , blowing up the refinery as they leave . Pappagallo and the other defenders of the tanker , as well as numerous marauders , are killed during the chase and the Gyro Captain is shot down . Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone , pursued by the marauders . Wez manages to board the truck and attack Max , but a head-on collision with Humungus s car kills both Wez and Humungus . Max loses control of the tanker and it rolls off the road . As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker , he sees not petrol , but sand , leaking from the tank . The truck and its trailer are thus exposed as a decoy , allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles . With Pappagallo dead , the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast , where they establish the Great Northern Tribe . Max remains alone in the desert , once again becoming a drifter . Years later , the Feral Kid , now the Northern Tribe s new leader ( voice by Harold Baigent ) , reminisces about the legend of the mythical Road Warrior ( Max ) who now exists only in distant memory .
