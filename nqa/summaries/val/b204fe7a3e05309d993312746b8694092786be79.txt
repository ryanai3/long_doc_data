The film opens in what will become North Texas , 35,000Ã‚ BC . Entering a cave , two cavemen hunters stumble upon a large extraterrestrial life form . One is killed by the creature while the other one fights and wins , stabbing the creature to death , but he is also infected by a black oil-like substance which crawls into his skin . In 1998 , in the same area , when a group of boys are digging a deep hole , a young boy named Stevie falls down the hole and finds a human skull . As he holds it , black oil seeps into his body until it reaches his head , causing his eyes to turn black . Later , four firefighters descend into the hole to rescue him , but do not come out . A team of biohazard-suited men arrives on the scene . Meanwhile , FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have been assigned to other projects since the closure of the X-Files . They are helping investigate a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas . Mulder inspects a building across the street from the supposed target and discovers the bomb in a vending machine . Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud stays behind to disarm the bomb as Mulder and Scully evacuate the building . Unknown to the agents , Michaud makes no effort to disarm the bomb , which detonates . Returning to Washington , D.C. , Mulder and Scully are chastised because , in addition to Michaud , five people were apparently still in the building during the bombing . There are scheduled separate hearings at which their job performances will be evaluated . That evening , Mulder encounters a paranoid doctor , Alvin Kurtzweil , who explains that the victims were the firefighters and boy , that they were already dead , and that the bomb was allowed to detonate in order to destroy evidence of how they died . At the hospital morgue , Scully is able to examine one of the victims , finding evidence of an alien virus . Meanwhile , Mulder and Scully s enemy , the Cigarette Smoking Man , meets with Dr. Ben Bronschweig in Texas , which they locate one of the firefighters who contains the same alien virus , but with an alien organism residing inside the body ; the Cigarette Smoking Man orders to administer a vaccine to it , but should it fail , have the body burned . Later , the alien organism gestates and kills Bronschweig . Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas . They come across a strange train hauling tanker trucks and they follow it to a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes . They enter the domes , only to find them empty . Suddenly , grates leading to an underground area open in the floor and a swarm of bees chases the agents out into the cornfield . Black helicopters appear and begin to chase them , but they escape and head back to Washington . After returning , Mulder unsuccessfully tries to get help from Kurtzweil , while Scully attends her performance hearing and learns that she is being transferred to Salt Lake City , Utah . Mulder is devastated to lose Scully as a partner . The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar . The sting causes Scully to quickly lose consciousness . Mulder calls for the paramedics but when an ambulance arrives , the driver shoots Mulder in the head and whisks Scully away . Waking up in hospital , Mulder is told the bullet only grazed his temple and leaves with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner . Mulder then meets a former adversary , the Well-Manicured Man , who gives him Scully s location in Antarctica , along with a vaccine to combat the virus that has infected her . The Well-Manicured Man then kills himself in a car bomb , before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered . Mulder travels to Antarctica to save Scully , and discovers a secret underground laboratory run by the Cigarette Smoking Man . Mulder uses the vaccine to revive Scully , disrupting the stable environment of the lab and reviving the cocooned aliens . The lab is destroyed just after Mulder and Scully escape to the surface . It turns out to be part of a huge alien vessel lying dormant beneath the snow ; the vessel pushes up through tons of ice and snow and travels straight up into the sky . Mulder watches the ship fly directly overhead and disappear into the distance , as Scully regains consciousness . Some time later , Scully attends a hearing , where her testimony is ignored and the evidence covered up . The only remaining proof of their ordeal is the bee that stung Scully , collected by the Lone Gunmen . She hands it over , noting that the FBI does not currently have an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence at hand . Outside , Mulder is reading an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas ; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him . At another crop outpost in Tunisia , the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder remains a threat , as he explains what Mulder has found out about the virus . He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened .
