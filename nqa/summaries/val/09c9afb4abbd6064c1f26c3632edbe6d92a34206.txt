Jack becomes nervous , and , disposing of the cell phone Pavel gave him , goes to nearby Castel del Monte , Abruzzo , instead . While in Abruzzo , Jack contacts Pavel , who sets him up with another job . He meets Mathilde ( Thekla Reuten ) , who wants him to build a custom sniper rifle for an assassination .

She is impressed by the craftsmanship , but asks him to make a few more adjustments . Later , Jack realizes that he is being followed by an assassin from Sweden , whom he kills . Jack is tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regrets killing Ingrid . His friendship and conversations with a local priest , Father Benedetto ( Paolo Bonacelli ) , encourage him to question his life choices .

When Father Benedetto tells Jack he senses he lives in a special kind of hell , a place without love , Jack starts to let himself feel love for Clara , and envisions a life with her . Jack talks to Pavel one last time—asking how the Swedes have found him . In his growing fear , he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse . He questions Clara about the gun and is satisfied with her explanation ( to defend herself , since there have been newspaper reports of murdered prostitutes ) .

He runs to Mathilde , who is dying on the pavement , and discovers that she also works for Pavel . As Jack goes to meet Clara , he hears Pavel behind him . They exchange gunfire and Pavel drops dead . As Jack drives to meet Clara at the river , he feels his abdomen and realizes he has been shot .
