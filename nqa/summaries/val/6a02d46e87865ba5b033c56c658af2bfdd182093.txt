On 6 October 1971 , American soldier Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division , deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War , when his close-knit unit comes under attack . As many of Jacob’s comrades are killed or wounded , others exhibit abnormal behavior , including catatonia and a bloody seizure . A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle , only to be bayoneted in the gut . Jacob awakens in 1975 , on a New York City Subway , with the novel The Stranger . Despite having a PhD , Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend , Jezzie . Jacob misses his wife and their three sons , especially the youngest , Gabe , who died before the war . He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences , including inexplicably locked subway exits , faceless vibrating people , a car trying to run him down , a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head , and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party , where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever . The comrade who had gone catatonic , Paul , contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences , but is immediately killed when his car explodes . Commiserating after the funeral , the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare . Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them , and they hire a lawyer to investigate . The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons . Jacob’s comrades also back out , looking scared , as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them . Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business , but he is able to jump from the moving car . Taken to the hospital , he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts , past demented , disfigured inmates . Trapped with doctors wielding barbaric metal instruments , he is told he is already dead , but denies it . He is taken out of the hospital by his friend Louis , who quotes the 14th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart : Eckhart saw Hell too . He said : The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won’t let go of life , your memories , your attachments . They burn them all away . But they’re not punishing you , he said . They’re freeing your soul . So , if you’re frightened of dying and ... you’re holding on , you’ll see devils tearing your life away . But if you’ve made your peace , then the devils are really angels , freeing you from the earth. Jacob is approached by a distressed Michael Newman , the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car . Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon . He designed the Ladder , a drug that massively increased aggression , taking people straight to their most primal urges . A dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit , who then turned on each other in a homicidal frenzy . At various times Jacob experiences the aftermath of his attack , such as being found gutted in the jungle and being evacuated under fire . At one point he awakens in his home before the war with his wife and all three sons , telling his wife he had a dream he was living with another woman , Jezzie . Eventually he re-experiences the traumatic moment , where it is a fellow American soldier who bayonets him . Finally given knowledge of what happened to him and why , in a calmer place , Jacob returns to his family s apartment . He sorts through his mementos , including his combat dog tags and honorable discharge . He is surprised to see his son Gabe at the foot of the stairwell , who takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps into a bright light . In a wartime triage tent , military doctors declare Jacob dead after putting up quite a fight . He has an expression of peace on his face , implying that he is finally dead .
