In a Californian forest , a group of alien botanists land in a spacecraft , collecting flora samples . When government agents appear on the scene , they flee in their spaceship , leaving one of their own behind in their haste . At a suburban home , a ten-year-old fatherless boy named Elliot , is trying to spend time with his brother , Michael , and his friends . As he returns from picking up a pizza , he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed . The creature promptly flees upon being discovered . Despite his family s disbelief , Elliot leaves Reese s Pieces candy to lure the creature to his bedroom . Before he goes to sleep , he realizes it is imitating his movements . He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it . Later that day , Michael and their five-year-old sister , Gertie , meet it . They decide to keep it hidden from their mother , Mary . When they ask it about its origin , it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving a dead chrysanthemum . At school the next day , Elliot begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien , including exhibiting signs of intoxication ( because it is at his home , drinking beer ) , and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class . As the alien watches John Wayne hug Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man on TV , Elliot hugs a girl he likes . He is then sent to the principal s office . The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches Sesame Street and , at Elliot s urging , dubs itself E.T . He reads a comic strip where Buck Rogers , stranded , calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself . E.T . receives Elliot s help in building a device to phone home by using a Speak & Spell toy . Michael notices that his health is declining and that Elliot is referring to himself as we . On Halloween , Michael and Elliot dress E.T . as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house . Elliot and E.T . ride the former s bike to the forest , where E.T . makes a successful call home . The next morning , Elliot wakes up in the field , only to find E.T . gone , so he returns home to his distressed family . Michael searches for and finds E.T . dying next to a culvert , being investigated by a raccoon . Michael takes him home to Elliot , who is also dying . Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son s illness and the dying E.T. , just as government agents invade the house . Scientists set up a medical facility there , quarantining Elliot and E.T . Their link disappears and E.T . then appears to die while Elliot recovers . A grief-stricken Elliot is left alone with the motionless E.T . when he notices a dead chrysanthemum , the plant E.T . had previously revived , coming back to life . E.T . reanimates and reveals that his people are returning . Elliot and Michael steal a van that E.T . had been loaded into and a chase ensues , with Steve s friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bike . Suddenly facing a police roadblock , they escape as E.T . uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest . Standing near the spaceship , E.T . s heart glows as he prepares to return home . Mary , Gertie , and Keys , a government agent , show up . E.T . says goodbye to Michael and Gertie , as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived . Before boarding the spaceship , he tells Elliot I ll be right here , pointing his glowing finger to his forehead . He then picks up the chrysanthemum , boards the spaceship , and it takes off , leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave .
