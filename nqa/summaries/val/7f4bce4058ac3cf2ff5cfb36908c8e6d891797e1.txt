Anna Khitrova , a British-Russian midwife at a London hospital , finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana , a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth . She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant , which is owned by Semyon , an old vor in the Russian Mafia . Anna thus sets out to track down the girl s family so that she can find a home for the baby girl , having meetings with Semyon , whom she initially regards as friendly . Anna s mother Helen does not discourage her , but Anna s Russian uncle and self-described former KGB officer , Stepan , whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary , urges caution . Through translation of the diary , Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his ignorant , unstable son Kirill had abused the girl , addicted her to heroin , forced her into prostitution , and raped her . Ultimately , Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon ( in several scenes it is made clear that Kirill is impotent and never had sex with Tatiana ) . Kirill s driver is Nikolai Luzhin , who also serves as the family cleaner , dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames . Through Nikolai , Semyon , fearing prosecution , promises to give the location of the girl s family to Anna if she hands back the diary . Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location , instead urging Anna to keep the baby in London . Semyon distrusts Anna s uncle Stepan and orders Nikolai to kill him . Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing . As Nikolai s star rises within the vory , an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member , due in part to Nikolai s protection of Semyon s incompetent son , who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a Kurdish associate , Azim . The hit was ill-advised and not approved by Semyon . Two Chechen hitmen soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim s mentally handicapped nephew who also took part in the hit . Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill s place during a meeting at the baths with Azim . The Chechens attack , thinking Nikolai is Kirill , but Nikolai kills them both , ending up in the hospital with severe wounds . It is revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang , working under license by the British Government and a senior police officer . As part of his undercover duties , Nikolai was able to read Tatiana s diary before Semyon destroyed it and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape , with a paternity test of Tatiana s baby as evidence . Stepan is also safe , hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection . Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her . But as Kirill sits by the Thames working up the courage to throw the child in , Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back . Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses . Nikolai and Anna kiss and part for the last time . Nikolai succeeds Semyon as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana s baby , whom she names Christine .
