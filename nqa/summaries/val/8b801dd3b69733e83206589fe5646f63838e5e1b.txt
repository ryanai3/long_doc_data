The narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than chance play important roles in life . Police officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman s apartment , finding a body in a closet . Dixon , a neighborhood boy , tries to tell him who committed the murder but Jim is dismissive . Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson . Claudia s neighbors called the police after she had an argument with her estranged father , children s game show host Jimmy Gator , and then blasted music while snorting cocaine . Unaware of her addiction , Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit . He asks her on a date that night ; she says yes . Jimmy hosts a long-running quiz show called What Do Kids Know ? and is dying of cancer ; he has only a few months to live . That night the newest child prodigy on What Do Kids Know ? , Stanley Spector , takes the lead as the show begins . He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults , who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break . When the show resumes , he wets himself and freezes , humiliated when everyone realizes what happened . As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens , and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage . But after Stanley s father berates him for freezing on air , Stanley refuses to return for the final round . Donnie Smith , a former What Do Kids Know ? champion , watches the show from a bar . Donnie s parents spent the money he won as a child , and he has been fired from his job at Solomon & Solomon , an electronics store , due to chronic lateness and poor sales . He is obsessed with getting oral surgery , thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces . He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces . The show s former producer , Earl Partridge , is also dying of cancer . Earl s trophy wife , Linda , collects his prescriptions for morphine while he is cared for by a nurse , Phil Parma . Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son , Frank Mackey , a motivational speaker peddling a pick-up artist self-help course to men . Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family . An angry Frank storms out of the interview when Phil gets through to him . Linda goes to see Earl s lawyer , begging him to change Earl s will . She admits she married Earl for his money , but now loves him and does not want it . The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money , which would go to Frank . Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage . Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank , but later apologizes . She drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol . Dixon finds Linda in her car , near death , and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse . Before his date with Claudia , Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun . When he meets Claudia they promise to be honest with each other , so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier . Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems , but Jim assures her that her past does not matter . They kiss , but she runs off . Jimmy Gator goes home to his wife Rose and confesses that he cheated on her . She asks why Claudia does not talk to him , and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her . Rose demands to know if it is true , but Jimmy says he can not remember whether he abused Claudia . Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone , and she walks out on him . Jimmy decides to kill himself . Donnie takes money from the Solomon & Solomon safe . As he drives away , he decides to return the money , but discovers he can not get back in as his key broke off in the lock . While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof , he is seen by a passing Jim . Suddenly , frogs begin falling from the sky , with multiple consequences : as Jimmy is about to shoot himself , frogs fall through his skylight , causing him to shoot the TV which sets his house on fire ; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia s apartment , but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter ; Earl dies as Frank watches the frogs ; Linda s ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room ; and , Donnie is knocked from the pole and smashes his teeth , then is dragged to safety by Jim . Jim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money ; his gun falls from the sky . Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda , who will recover from her attempted suicide . Stanley , on his way to bed , tells his father that he needs to be nicer to him , but his father ignores him and simply tells him to go to bed . Jim goes to see Claudia , telling her he wants to make things work between them ; she smiles in reply .
