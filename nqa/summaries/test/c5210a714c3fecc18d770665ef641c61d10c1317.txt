An anonymous flasher exposes himself to shoppers in the Forest Ridge Mall parking lot . The head of mall security , Ronald Ronnie Barnhardt ( Rogen ) , makes it his mission to apprehend the offender . He is assisted by Charles , Dennis , and the Yuen twins ( John and Matthew Yuan ) , in his efforts . The next day , Ronnie s dream girl , Brandi ( Faris ) , who works a mall make-up counter , encounters the flasher . Ronnie tries to comfort her until a police officer , Detective Harrison , arrives and takes over Ronnie s palliative role . Ronnie is upset that his boss allowed an outsider to infringe on his search for the offender . The criminal activity at the mall continues , as a masked person is seen robbing a shoe store , causing property damage . Detective Harrison is once again called in to investigate , his efforts hindered by Ronnie , who thinks that Saddamn , an Arab shopkeeper in the mall is the thief , based on the fact that he is an Arab . Ronnie curses Saddamn out , and Harrison profanely excoriates Ronnie for this during a meeting with Ronnie s superior , and in response , Ronnie decides to take steps to become a police officer . As part of his preparations , Ronnie decides to ride along with Detective Harrison . Harrison , fed up with Ronnie , tricks him into walking into the most dangerous part of town , and drives off . Ronnie then confronts and subsequently assaults several drug dealers , victoriously returning to the police station with a dealer s son and thanking the detective for the opportunity to prove himself . Emboldened , Ronnie arranges a date with Brandi . On their date , Brandi sees Ronnie taking a prescription clonazepam , and thinking that Ronnie takes them recreationally , she asks him for the bottle . She consumes multiple tablets herself while drinking . Ronnie takes her home and rapes her while she is apparently semi-conscious , and at one point , when he stops mid-coitus , she says groggily , Why are you stopping , motherfucker ? , compelling him to continue . Ronnie passes the background check and physical examination for the police officer job , but fails the psychological examination . Nell , a friendly food court worker , explains to him that her boss , Roger and Trina , another female employee make fun of Nell for having her leg in a cast . Ronnie then beats up Roger and warns him and Trina not to harass Nell again . Depressed , he is persuaded by Dennis to spend the day doing a wide variety of drugs and assaulting skateboarding teenagers . At the end of the day , Ronnie finds out that Dennis was the shoe thief , and that he has been stealing from the mall for some time . Ronnie is stunned and , after a brief argument , is knocked unconscious by Dennis , who then flees to Mexico . Ronnie decides to go undercover in order to catch the flasher . At night he sees Harrison having sex with Brandi , and he confronts her in front of onlookers at the mall the next day , blowing his cover and inadvertently destroying a display case . When the police are summoned , Ronnie fights them and Harrison . Ronnie loses the fight and is arrested . After a night in jail , Ronnie s mom gives him a postcard from Dennis in Mexico . Dennis admits that he respects Ronnie for caring so much . The next day , Ronnie returns to the mall , fired from his job . Despondent , he sits at a food court table , where Nell , whose cast has been removed , and is sporting a more flattering hairdo , brings him a complimentary cup of coffee . As a vulnerable Ronnie expresses his sadness over his situation , Nell kisses him . Interrupting their romantic moment , the flasher exposes himself to Nell and Ronnie and runs off , exposing himself to many other mall patrons . Ronnie , pursuing the flasher in a slow-motion sequence that includes him punching Saddamn in the face , retrieves a gun and shoots the flasher in the shoulder as he charges toward Brandi . Refusing the flasher an ambulance , Ronnie brings the flasher to his feet to take him to the police station , and as he does so , his boss , Mark rehires him . Though Brandi compliments Ronnie on a job well done , Ronnie rejects her compliment and humiliates her publicly for betraying him . Ronnie drops the flasher off at the police station , and boasts to Harrison of his feat , saying that he does not need a badge or gun to know who he is . Ronnie is then interviewed by the local news with Nell and his fellow security guards by his side .
