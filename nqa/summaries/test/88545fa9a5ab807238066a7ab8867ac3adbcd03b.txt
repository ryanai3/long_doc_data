Famed novelist Paul Sheldon ( James Caan ) is the author of a successful series of Regency romance novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain . Wanting to focus on more serious stories , he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career . While traveling from Silver Creek , Colorado to his home in New York City , he is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road , rendering him unconscious . Paul is rescued by a nurse named Annie Wilkes ( Kathy Bates ) , who brings him to her remote home . When Paul regains consciousness he finds himself bedridden , with both his legs broken as well as a dislocated shoulder . Annie claims she is his number one fan and talks a lot about him and his novels . As a reward for saving him , Paul gives Annie his new manuscript which she saved from the wreckage . While feeding him , she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but regains control and apologizes . She buys a copy of Paul s most recently published book , Misery s Child , giving glowing praise to Paul as she progresses through the book . However , when Annie discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book she flies into a rage , almost smashing a table on Paul s head . She reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities ; nobody knows where he is . Annie leaves and Paul tries to escape from his room , but she has locked the door . The next morning , Annie forces Paul to burn his latest manuscript . When he is well enough to get out of bed , she insists he write a new novel entitled Misery s Return , in which he brings the character back to life . Paul complies , believing Annie might kill him otherwise . He also tells her he will use Annie s name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health . However , having found a way of escaping his room , he sneaks out when Annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers . He tries poisoning Annie during a candlelit dinner , but fails when she accidentally spills her drugged wine . During another venture out of his room , Paul finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about Annie s past . He discovers that she was suspected and tried for the deaths of several infants , but the trial crumbled due to lack of evidence . Paul also learns that Annie quoted lines he had written in his Misery novels during her trial . Annie later drugs Paul and straps him to the bed . When he wakes , she tells him that she knows he has been out of his room and breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from trying to escape again . The local sheriff , Buster ( Richard Farnsworth ) , is investigating Paul s disappearance . When a shopkeeper informs the sheriff he has sold Annie considerable quantities of typing paper , Buster surmises Paul must be at the Wilkes farm . Buster pays Annie a visit , who permits the sheriff to inspect the residence . When Buster finds Paul drugged and hidden in the basement , Annie fatally shoots Buster and tells Paul that they must die together . He agrees , on the condition that he must finish the novel in order to give Misery back to the world . While she gets his chair , Paul conceals a can of lighter fluid in his pocket . When the book is done , he reminds Annie it is his practice to have a single cigarette and a glass of champagne after finishing a novel . When Annie gives these things to Paul , he tells her that this time , he will need a second glass , for her . As Annie gets a second glass , Paul soaks the manuscript in the lighter fluid . When Annie returns with the glass he sets the manuscript on fire , giving him the chance to hit Annie over the head with the typewriter . Paul and Annie fight and Annie is killed . Eighteen months later , Paul , now walking with a cane , meets his publishing agent Marcia ( Lauren Bacall ) in a restaurant in New York City . The two discuss his first non-Misery novel . Marcia tells him about the positive early buzz which Paul does not care about , saying he wrote the novel for himself . Marcia asks if he would consider a non-fiction book about his captivity , but Paul declines . While at the restaurant , he imagines the waitress as Annie . The waitress says she is his number one fan , to which Paul uncomfortably responds That s very sweet of you .
