During a softball game at an American oil company housing compound in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , al-Qaeda terrorists set off a bomb , killing Americans and Saudis . While one team hijacks a car and shoots residents , a suicide bomber ( wearing a fake police uniform ) blows himself up , killing everyone near him . Sergeant Haytham ( Ali Suliman ) of the Saudi State Police kills several of the terrorists . The FBI Legal AttachĂŠ in Saudi Arabia , Special Agent Fran Manner ( Kyle Chandler ) , calls his US colleague , Special Agent Ronald Fleury ( Jamie Foxx ) , to advise him about the attack . Manner is discussing the situation with DSS Regional Security Officer Special Agent Rex Bura when an ambulance full of explosives is detonated killing Manner , Bura and many others . At FBI Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , Fleury briefs his rapid deployment team on the attack . Although the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. State Department hinder FBI efforts to investigate the attack , Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into allowing an FBI investigative team into Saudi Arabia . Fleury gathers Special Agent Janet Mayes ( Jennifer Garner ) , a forensic examiner , FBI analyst Adam Leavitt ( Jason Bateman ) , an intelligence analyst , and Special Agent Grant Sykes ( Chris Cooper ) , a bomb technician , go to Saudi Arabia . On arrival they are met by Colonel Faris al-Ghazi ( Ashraf Barhom ) , the commander of the Saudi State Police Force providing security at the compound . The investigation is being run by General Al Abdulmalik ( Mahmoud Said ) of the Saudi Arabian National Guard ( SANG ) , who does not give Fleury and his team permission to investigate . The FBI team is invited to the palace of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Khaled ( Omar Berdouni ) for a dinner . While at the palace , Fleury persuades the Prince that Colonel al-Ghazi is a natural detective and should be allowed to lead the investigation . With this change in leadership , the Americans are allowed hands-on access to the crime scene . While searching for evidence , Sergeant Haytham ( Ali Suliman ) and Sykes discover the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance . Fleury learns the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms . Colonel al-Ghazi orders a SWAT team to raid a house , managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists . Following the raid , the team discovers clues , including photos of the U.S. and other Western embassies in Riyadh . Soon afterward , the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Damon Schmidt ( Jeremy Piven ) notifies Fleury and his team that they have been ordered to return to the United States . On their way to King Khalid International Airport , their convoy is attacked and incapacitated . Leavitt is dragged out of the wrecked car and kidnapped by terrorists who flee while Fleury manages to wound one attacker . Al-Ghazi commandeers a civilian vehicle to chase the fourth SUV and the other car holding Leavitt into the dangerous Al-Suwaidi neighborhood of Riyadh . As they pull up , a gunman launches rocket-propelled grenades at them and a fierce firefight starts . FBI analyst Leavitt is tied up inside a complex . While Sykes and Haytham watch the entrance to the complex , al-Ghazi , Fleury , and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside . Mayes , separated from the others , finds Leavitt and his attackers , preparing an execution video for Leavitt . She kills the remaining insurgents , and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave . Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment , and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather and inspects his hand . When the old man gives him his hand , al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group s many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader . Abu Hamza s teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck , then he starts to point his gun at Mayes , prompting Fleury to kill him . Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him . As Abu Hamza dies , another grandson hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down . Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury s arms . At al-Ghazi s house , Fleury and Haytham meet his family . Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend , mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie wherein he comforted Special Agent Manner s son . Fleury and his team return to the U.S. , where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace ( Richard Jenkins ) for their outstanding work . Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had whispered to her to calm her down . The scene cuts to Abu Hamza s daughter asking her own daughter what his grandfather whispered to her as he was dying . The granddaughter tells her mother , Do n't fear them , my child . We are going to kill them all , a similar line Fleury whispered to Mayes , implying that this is a never-ending , vicious cycle .
