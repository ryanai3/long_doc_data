Randolph Smiley ( Robin Williams ) is the host of The Rainbow Randolph Show , a popular children s television series broadcast on the fictional network Kidnet . Despite his friendly appearance on-stage , off-stage he is a corrupt and alcoholic businessman who secretly accepts bribes from parents who want to put their kids on his show . After an FBI sting exposes him , Randolph is fired and his show is cancelled . He is also kicked out of his corporate penthouse and loses all of his money , leaving him homeless , unemployed , and broke . Kidnet replaces Randolph with the squeaky clean Sheldon Mopes ( Edward Norton ) and his character , Smoochy the Rhino . Mopes is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality child entertainment , and despite doubts from his hardened producer Nora Wells ( Catherine Keener ) , his show quickly becomes tremendously popular . Meanwhile , Randolph turns to his former associate Marion Frank Stokes ( Jon Stewart ) and pleads to help him get his job back , but Stokes refuses , saying that he ca n't even be seen talking to Randolph . Randolph then turns to his former partner Angelo Pike ( Danny Woodburn ) and asks him to stay at his apartment , to which Angelo reluctantly agrees . Mopes quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to Nora and with the help of his new agent Burke Bennett ( Danny DeVito ) , Mopes renegotiates his contract and is named executive producer . Irish mob boss Tommy Cotter ( Pam Ferris ) approaches Mopes and asks him to create a spot on his show for her cousin Spinner Dunn ( Michael Rispoli ) , a former boxer whose numerous head injuries have left him with brain damage . Mopes reluctantly adds Spinner to the show , first as a cowbell-wielding game warden , and later on as Smoochy s cousin Moochy . Mopes is horrified to learn that Burke has signed him up to star in a Smoochy ice show , as he fears that the event will exploit children . Burke and Merv Green ( Harvey Fierstein ) , the head of the corrupt charity running the ice show , warn Mopes not to back out of the event but he does so anyway . Soon afterward , a disguised Randolph tricks Mopes into performing a Smoochy act at a neo-Nazi rally that is raided by the police . Mopes is branded a racist and loses his job and show . However , when Randolph barges into Nora s apartment and tries to convince her to help him get his job back , he accidentally reveals that he set Mopes up . Tommy and her crew then barge into Angelo s apartment and force Randolph to confess that he tricked Sheldon before beating him up and turning him over to the police . As a result , Smoochy s reputation and show are restored and Randolph is dubbed the most hated man in America by the media . To make matters worse , Angelo kicks Randolph out of his apartment after he smashes his TV in a fit of rage . After telling him that his show is back on the air , Nora kisses Mopes and has sex with him , starting a relationship . Mopes then decides to perform in an ice show , but rather than involve the corrupt charities , he decides that half the proceeds of the ice show should go to the drug rehabilitation clinic where he used to work while the other half to child literacy enhancement programs . Also , the children who attend the show will be given free souvenirs and healthy snacks . Burke and Green retaliate by plotting to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming . However , their plan backfires when during a rehearsal , Green s men mistake Spinner in his Moochy costume for Mopes and murder him . When Tommy and her men get word of his death , they retaliate by killing Green and his men . Meanwhile , Randolph corners Mopes and Nora in their penthouse and threatens to kill them . Randolph reveals to Sheldon that Nora has had affairs with numerous children s show hosts , including Randolph himself . Sheldon is hurt by this , but Nora insists that she has genuine feelings for him . They manage to talk Randolph down and discover that he is depressed and genuinely misses entertaining children . Randolph has a change of heart and an empathetic Sheldon offers to let him stay in the penthouse until he recovers . Burke and Stokes decide to partner up after hearing of Green s death . They hire Buggy Ding Dong ( Vincent Schiavelli ) , another former kid show host who became a heroin addict , to assassinate Mopes during his ice show . Buggy steals a backstage pass to get inside , but before he can shoot Mopes he is confronted by Randolph . They struggle for the sniper rifle until Buggy falls to his death in the ice rink . After Mopes realizes that Burke and Stokes set him up , he chases Burke into an alley . Mopes pulls a gun and threatens to kill Burke , but Tommy and her men arrive and persuade him not to forfeit his high ideals . Tommy decides to take care of Burke and Stokes in her own way , Mopes and Nora share a kiss in Times Square and the movie ends with Smoochy and Randolph launching a new show together .
