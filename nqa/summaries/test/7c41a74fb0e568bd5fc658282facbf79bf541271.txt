In early 1950s Los Angeles , Patrolman Sergeant Edmund Ed Exley ( Guy Pearce ) , the son of the legendary LAPD detective Preston Exley , is determined to live up to his father s reputation . His intelligence , insistence on following regulations , and cold demeanor contribute to his isolation from other officers . He exacerbates this resentment by volunteering to testify in the Bloody Christmas case in exchange for a promotion to Detective Lieutenant . This goes against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith ( James Cromwell ) , who states that a detective should be willing to shoot a guilty man in the back for the greater good . Exley s ambition is fueled by the murder of his father , killed by an unknown assailant , whom Exley nicknames Rollo Tomasi . Officer Wendell Bud White ( Russell Crowe ) , whom Exley considers a mindless thug , is a plainclothes officer obsessed with violently punishing woman-beaters . One such incident leads him to confront a former cop named Leland Buzz Meeks , a driver for Pierce Patchett ( David Strathairn ) . White comes to dislike Exley after White s partner , Dick Stensland , is fired due to Exley s testimony in the Bloody Christmas scandal . White is sought out by Smith for a job in which they harass and beat up out-of-town criminals trying to fill the void left in Los Angeles following the imprisonment of gangster Mickey Cohen for tax evasion . The Nite Owl case , a multiple homicide at a coffee shop , becomes personal after Stensland is found to be one of the victims . Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes ( Kevin Spacey ) is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical advisor on Badge of Honor , a popular TV police drama series . He is providing Sid Hudgens ( Danny DeVito ) , publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine , with tips about celebrity arrests that will attract more readers to Hudgens ' magazine . When he becomes involved in Hudgen s scheme to set up actor Matt Reynolds ( Simon Baker ) in a homosexual tryst with L.A. district attorney Ellis Loew ( Ron Rifkin ) , and Reynolds is killed as a result , Vincennes becomes determined to find the killer . Three African Americans are initially charged with the Nite Owl murders , and later killed in a shootout . Although the Nite Owl crime initially looks like a botched robbery , Exley and White individually investigate it to discover indications of corruption all around them . White recognizes Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts as one of Meeks ' escorts which leads him back to Pierce Patchett , operator of Fleur-de-Lis , a call girl service that runs prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble film stars . He begins a relationship with Lynn Bracken ( Kim Basinger ) , a Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute . The body count rises when White searches a storage room under Lefferts ' mother s house , and finds the decomposed corpse of Meeks . When Vincennes approaches Smith with the evidence he has found with Exley , Smith realizes his scheme to take over Mickey Cohen s heroin empire is threatened . Smith shoots Vincennes , who utters Rollo Tomasi before dying , the origin of which Exley told Vincennes in confidence . Exley s suspicions are aroused when Smith asks him who Rollo Tomasi is . During an interrogation of Hudgens , Smith arranges for White to see photos of Bracken sleeping with Exley , which sends White into a rage . Confident that White has gone after Exley to kill him , Smith kills Hudgens . Exley investigates and discovers Meeks and Stensland used to work closely with Smith . White drives to the police station and begins to fight Exley , but Exley is able to convince White that Smith is corrupt and has set them both up . The two decide to team together to take down Smith . They are able to obtain evidence against Smith by threatening Loew , and later find Patchett murdered . Exley and White realize that Smith himself has been taking over after Cohen , and the killings have been Smith tying up loose ends . Exley and White are set up with a trap against Smith and his hitmen . After a gunfight that kills all the hitmen , Smith shoots White in the face , but then is forced to surrender to Exley . As police arrive , Exley shoots Smith in the back , killing him . The LAPD cover up Smith s crimes and say he died a hero in the shootout to protect the department s image , and in exchange Exley bargains to also be hailed a hero and receives a medal for his bravery . Upon leaving City Hall , Exley sees Bracken , who tells him she is returning home to Arizona with White , revealing White survived the shooting . Exley and White shake hands and Bracken drives off into the sunset .
