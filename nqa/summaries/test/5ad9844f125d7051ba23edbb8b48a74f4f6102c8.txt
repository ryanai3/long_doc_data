When Charlie helps her pack , they talk about his feelings for her ; she is angry that he never acted on them . They begin to engage sexually , but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam . Charlie begins to realise that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his aunt Helen as a little boy . In an epilogue , Charlie is discovered by his parents in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father . After being admitted to a mental hospital , it emerges that Helen sexually abused him when he was young , and his love for her ( and empathy for her troubled youth ) caused him to repress his traumatic memories . This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book . In two months Charlie is released , and Sam and Patrick visit him . In the epilogue , Sam , Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite . He comes to terms with his past : Even if we do n't have the power to choose where we come from , we can still choose where we go from there . Charlie decides to participate in life , and his letter-writing ends .
