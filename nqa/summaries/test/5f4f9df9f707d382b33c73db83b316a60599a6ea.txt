In April 2054 , Washington , D.C. s PreCrime police stops murderers before they act , reducing the murder rate to zero . Murders are predicted using three mutated humans , called Precogs , who previsualize crimes by receiving visions of the future . Would-be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality . The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program . Since the disappearance of his son Sean , PreCrime Captain John Anderton has separated from his wife Lara and becomes a drug addict . While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program , the Precogs generate a new prediction , saying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours . Anderton does not know Crow , but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt . Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman , the creator of PreCrime technology . She reveals that sometimes , one of the Precogs , usually Agatha , has a different vision than the other two , a minority report of a possible alternate future ; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system s credibility . Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence . Anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the city-wide optical recognition system . He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha , shutting down the system , as the Precogs operate as a group mind . Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow , but none exists ; instead , Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively , a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049 . Anderton and Agatha go to Crow s apartment as the 36-hour time nears , finding numerous photos of children , including Sean s . Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him , accusing him to be a serial child killer . Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it . Crow however begs to be killed , having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family s financial well being . Crow grabs Anderton s gun and pushes the trigger , killing himself . Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara s house outside the city for refuge . There they learn Lively was Agatha s drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime . Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha , but was murdered . Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively s existence and her connection to Agatha . Witwer , studying Crow s death , suspects Anderton is being framed . He examines the footage of Lively s murder and finds there were two attempts on her life , the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second , occurring minutes later , having succeeded . Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime , Lamar Burgess , but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton s gun . With the Precogs still offline , the murder is not detected . Lara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her , and Anderton is captured , accused of both murders , and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep . As his body is deposited into the prison , the warden tells him , that all your dreams come true.â Agatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system . While attempting to comfort Lara , Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively s murderer . Lara frees Anderton from stasis , and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha s vision of Burgess killing Lively . A new report is generated at PreCrime : Burgess will kill Anderton . Burgess corners Anderton , and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime , he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life , so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored . Anderton points out Burgess s dilemma : If Burgess kills Anderton , he will be imprisoned for life , but PreCrime will be validated ; if he spares Anderton , PreCrime will be discredited and shut down . Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system : once people are aware of their future , they are able to change it . Burgess shoots himself . After Burgess s death , the PreCrime system is shut down and all prisoners pardoned . Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together . The Precogs are sent to an isolated island to live their lives in peace .
