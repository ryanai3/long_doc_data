Dr. Bill Capa ( Willis ) , a New York City psychologist , falls into a deep depression after an unstable patient commits suicide in front of him by jumping from his office window . The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness , taking away his ability to see the color red . To restart his life , Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend , fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore ( Bakula ) , who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session . But one night Moore is violently murdered in the office and Capa is plunged into the mystery of his friend s death . Moore would gather his patients every Monday for a discussion of their problems . Police detective Lt. Hector Martinez ( Blades ) considers them , and possibly Capa , suspects in the murder . Capa continues to live in Moore s house and begins an affair with Rose ( March ) , a mysterious girl who comes and goes . He takes over Moore s therapy group and learns of their pasts and obsessions : Clark ( Brad Dourif ) suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things . He also has a violent temper , and months earlier beat up his wife . Sondra ( Lesley Ann Warren ) is a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac . She stabbed her father with a knife and fork and her husband died of unnatural causes . Buck ( Lance Henriksen ) is a suicidal ex-cop . The murder of his wife and daughter remains unsolved . Casey ( Kevin J. O'Connor ) , the arrogant son of a wealthy man , paints sado-masochist works of art . He once burned down his father s house . Richie is a transgender 16-year-old who wishes to transition to female . Richie also has social anxiety disorder , a stutter and a history of drug use . One of these patients is violently murdered . Capa also becomes the target of several attempts on his life . He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose . This leads to a twist ending : Richie is really Rose , and the murders have been committed by her deranged brother Dale ( Andrew Lowery ) . They once had an actual brother named Richie who was molested by a child psychiatrist named Niedelmeyer . Richie committed suicide and , unable to cope with the loss , Dale forced Rose to play the part of their brother . Dale â who was also one of Niedelmeyer s victims â began abusing Rose until she actually became Richie . When Richie was arrested for drug possession , he was forced into therapy . Rose soon started to re-emerge and , under another personality , Bonnie , started relationships with other members of the group . Dale proceeded to kill them , fearing that they would soon link Rose to Richie . Capa confronts them and is overpowered by Dale , who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose . Deeply traumatized , she then tries to commit suicide . Capa is able to stop her , bookending the story with two suicide attempts â one at the beginning , resulting in Capa s loss of color vision , and one at the end , thwarted and resulting in his regaining it .
