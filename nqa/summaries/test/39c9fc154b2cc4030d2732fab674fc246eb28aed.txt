In 1846 , Benjamin Barker , a barber , arrives in London , accompanied by sailor Anthony Hope . Fifteen years earlier , he was falsely convicted and sentenced to penal transportation by the corrupt Judge Turpin , who lusted after Barker s wife Lucy . Barker adopts the alias Sweeney Todd and returns to his old Fleet Street shop , situated above Mrs. Nellie Lovett s meat pie shop . He learns that Turpin raped Lucy , who then poisoned herself with arsenic . The couple s daughter , Johanna , is now Turpin s ward , and is the object of Turpin s lust . Todd vows revenge , and re-opens his barber shop after Mrs. Lovett returns his straight razors to him . Anthony becomes enamored with Johanna , but is caught by Turpin and driven away by his corrupt associate , Beadle Bamford . Todd denounces faux-Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli s hair tonic as a fraudulent mix and humiliates him in a public shaving contest . A few days later , Pirelli arrives at Todd s shop , with his boy assistant Tobias Ragg . Mrs. Lovett keeps Toby occupied while Pirelli identifies himself as Todd s former assistant , Davy Collins , and threatens to reveal Todd s secret unless Todd gives him half his earnings . Todd kills Collins to protect his secret , and hides his body in a trunk . After receiving advice from Bamford , Turpin , intending marriage to Johanna , visits Todd s shop for grooming . Todd shaves Turpin , preparing to slit his throat ; they are interrupted by Anthony , who reveals his plan to elope with Johanna before noticing Turpin . Turpin leaves enraged and Todd vents his rage by killing customers while waiting for another chance to kill Turpin , and Mrs. Lovett bakes the victims into pies . Todd rigs his barber s chair with a pedal-operated mechanism that deposits his victims through a trap door into Mrs. Lovett s basement bake-house . Anthony searches for Johanna , whom Turpin has sent to an insane asylum upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony . The barbering and pie-making businesses prosper , and Mrs. Lovett takes Toby as her assistant . Mrs. Lovett tells an uninterested Todd of her plans to marry him and move to the seaside . Anthony discovers Johanna s whereabouts and poses as a wig-maker s apprentice to rescue her . Todd has Toby deliver a letter to Turpin , telling him where Johanna will be brought when Anthony frees her . Toby has become wary of Todd and tells Mrs. Lovett of his suspicion . Bamford arrives at the pie shop , informing Mrs. Lovett that neighbors have been complaining of the stink from her chimney . He is distracted by Todd s offer of a free grooming and is murdered by Todd . Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of Toby s suspicions , and the pair search for Toby , whom Mrs. Lovett has locked in the bake-house . He has hidden himself in the sewers after seeing Bamford s body drop into the room from the trap door above , as well as finding a human toe in a pie . Anthony brings Johanna , disguised as a sailor , to the shop , and has her wait there while he leaves to find a coach . A beggar woman enters the shop in search of Bamford . She recognizes Todd , but upon hearing Turpin s voice , Todd kills her and sends her through the trap door . As Turpin enters , Todd explains that Johanna had repented and offers a free shave ; when Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker , Todd stabs him several times before cutting his throat . Upon seeing Johanna , Todd prepares to slit her throat as well , not recognizing her as his daughter . Hearing Mrs. Lovett scream in horror as a dying Turpin grabs her dress , Todd instead spares Johanna s life . Todd discovers that the beggar woman was his wife Lucy , whom he believed to be dead , and that Mrs. Lovett misled him about her death . Todd pretends to forgive her and dances with her before hurling her into the bake-house oven , then cradles his wife s dead body in his arms . Toby climbs from the sewers and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor . He leaves the basement as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife .
