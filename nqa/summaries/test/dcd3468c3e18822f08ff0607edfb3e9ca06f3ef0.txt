The Grudge describes a curse that is born when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage or extreme sorrow . The curse is an entity created where the person died . Those who encounter this evil supernatural force die ; and the curse is reborn repeatedly , passed from victim to victim in an endless , growing chain of horror . The following events are explained in their actual order ; the original film is presented in a non-linear narrative . The Saeki family lived happily in suburban Tokyo , but housewife Kayako Saeki fell in love with her college professor , Peter Kirk , obsessively writing about him in her diary . However , her husband Takeo discovered the diary . Believing Kayako was having an affair , he became mentally disturbed and murdered his wife by pushing her off the stairs , snapping her neck to a 90 degree angle and crushing her throat . He then drowned his young son Toshio - who witnessed the act - in the bathtub to cover his tracks , along with the pet cat , Mar . Takeo hid the bodies in the attic and closet , before Kayako s ghost murdered him by hanging him with her hair in Toshio s bedroom . Peter came to the Saeki house to speak to Kayako after receiving a letter from her , only to find her corpse . Shocked , he fled the house , killing himself the next day by falling over the balcony of his building complex in front of his wife . The Saeki family rose again as ghosts due to their rage and sorrow , notably Kayako , who appears as an onryĹ ghost , leaving the curse on the house . The present timeline starts a few years later with the Williams family moving in from America . While husband Matt is thrilled with the house , his wife Jennifer and dementia-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable . Jennifer is quickly consumed by the curse . Matt returns home to find the house trashed , Emma upset , and his wife dying . Matt and Jennifer are killed by Toshio . Yoko , a careworker , arrives at the house the next day to find Emma alone , and encounters Kayako , who attacks her . Concerned about Yoko s disappearance , her employer Alex sends another careworker , Karen Davis , to take over the care for Emma . At the house , Karen is shocked when she finds a seemingly alive Toshio and Mar in the closet , contacting Alex for help . Alex finds Emma dead in the house and Karen in a state of shock after her first encounter with Kayako , and summons the police , including Detective Nakagawa . Nakagawa and his partner Igarashi explore the house , finding the bodies of Matt and Jennifer in the attic along with a human s lower jaw . Matt s sister Susan disappears after being followed and attacked by Kayako , and Alex is killed when visited by a Kayako-possessed Yoko missing her lower jaw . Karen begins to be haunted by Kayako herself , informing her boyfriend Doug of the situation . She researches the origins of the house , eventually confronting Nakagawa , who explains three of his colleagues investigating the Saeki deaths all were consumed by the curse . That night , Nakagawa goes to the house and tries to burn it down , but is killed by Takeo . Karen races to the house upon learning Doug has ventured there to look for her , experiencing a vision in which she sees Peter visiting the house and finding Kayako s corpse . Karen finds Doug paralyzed by fear , and attempts to flee the house with him , only to witness Kayako as she drags herself down the stairs and crawls on Doug , causing him to die of fright . Karen spots the petrol and manages to ignite it with Doug s lighter just as Kayako is about to kill her . Karen is whisked to a hospital , but learns the house survived the fire . Visiting Doug s body , Karen realizes she is still haunted by Kayako , who appears behind her as the camera circles to reveal her wide staring eye .
