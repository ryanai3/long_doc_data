In London , the British mob boss Lenny Cole ( Tom Wilkinson ) rules the growing real estate business using a corrupt Councillor ( Jimi Mistry ) for the bureaucratic services and his henchman Archy ( Mark Strong ) for the dirty work . A billionaire Russian businessman , Uri Omovich ( Karel Roden ) , plans a crooked land deal , and London s crooks all want a piece of it . Other key players include the underhand accountant Stella ( Thandie Newton ) and ambitious small-time crook One-Two ( Gerard Butler ) leading a group called the Wild Bunch which includes Mumbles ( Idris Elba ) and Handsome Bob ( Tom Hardy ) . Lenny charges Uri âŹ7,000,000 for the crooked deal ; Uri has his accountant Stella find funds . Uri lends his lucky painting to Lenny as a sign of friendship . Stella , however , double-crosses Uri and tips off the Wild Bunch to steal the money , while the painting is stolen from Lenny s wall by his junkie rocker stepson Johnny Quid ( Toby Kebbell ) , who disappears . Lenny and Archy coerce his former managers Mickey ( Chris Ludacris Bridges ) and Roman ( Jeremy Piven ) into tracking down Johnny . Handsome Bob also gets close to a lawyer who has information on a prevalent undercover informer in their criminal circle . After Uri s money is stolen by the Wild Bunch a second time , his assistant Victor begins to suspect that it is Lenny who has been stealing the money and purposely keeping Uri s painting from him to resell it . This theory enrages Uri , who lures Lenny to a private golf game in order to break his leg , warning him to return his painting without delay . Cookie ( Matt King ) happens to buy the painting from some crackheads who had just stolen it from Johnny s hideout . Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who , in turn , offers the painting to Stella ( after a sexual encounter ) as a token of appreciation . After Stella leaves his flat , One-Two is surprised by Uri s henchmen but is rescued , and then kidnapped , by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri s money . Uri wants to marry Stella , whom he has long admired . At Stella s house he proposes , but he spots the painting . Stella lies and says she has had it for years . Uri , enraged by this and realizing that Stella betrayed him , orders Victor to kill her . Archy brings Johnny , Roman , Mickey and the Wild Bunch to Lenny s warehouse where Lenny orders Johnny executed . He demands that the Wild Bunch tell him where the money is or else they will be killed very slowly . Handsome Bob offers the legal documents concerning the informant in his pocket to Archy . Archy recognizes the pseudonym used on documents , Sydney Shaw , as belonging to Lenny . Lenny arranged with the police to routinely lock up many criminal associates ( including Archy himself ) for years at a time in order to enhance his own standing in the criminal underworld and to ensure his own freedom . Archy orders Lenny s men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny drowned and fed to crayfish . In the lift , Johnny graphically explains to Roman and Mickey that they will also be killed in order to leave no witnesses , and graphically explains the manner of their executions . His description unnerves the man who s to execute the three men , prompting him to act prematurely . Having also already anticipated this move , Johnny warns Mickey and Roman to intervene and kill their would-be executioner . Johnny shoots two more men waiting at the top of the lift and they escape the last of Archy s men ( with the help of the Wild Bunch ) . Later , Archy picks up Johnny from rehab . Archy gives Uri s lucky painting to Johnny as a peace offering . Archy says that obtaining the painting cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg implying he had Uri killed . Johnny proclaims that , with his new-found freedom from addiction and his father , he will do what he could not before : become a real RocknRolla .
