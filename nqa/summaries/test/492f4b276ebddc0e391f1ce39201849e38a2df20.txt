Two Irish American fraternal twin brothers , Connor and Murphy MacManus , attend a Catholic Mass , where the priest mentions the fate of Kitty Genovese . Later , when Connor and Murphy are celebrating St. Patrick s Day with friends , three Russian mobsters arrive and announce they want to close the pub and take over the land it is built on . A brawl ensues and the next morning , when two of the Russians seek revenge on Connor and Murphy , the mobsters are killed in an act of self-defense . FBI Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case , and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes . The duo turn themselves in at a police station , where Smecker interviews them . After they retell their incident to Smecker , he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media . That night , they receive what appears to be a calling from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish . Connor and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men . Connor learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel . Having equipped themselves with weaponry from a local underground gun dealer , the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters , while Rocco , a friend of the brothers and mob errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe Papa Joe Yakavetta , is sent in on an independent hit as an unknowing throwaway . The next day , Rocco learns that he was betrayed by Papa Joe , the hit amounting to an attempt to have Rocco killed by the nine Russian mobsters as he was sent in with only a six-shot revolver . As a result , Rocco commits himself to help Connor and Murphy . That night , the MacManus brothers and Rocco hunt down an underboss of the Yakavetta crime family , Vincenzo Lapazzi , and kill him . Concerned he may be a target , Papa Joe contacts a hitman , Il Duce , to deal with them . After killing a criminal that Rocco had a personal hatred for , the three men are ambushed by Il Duce . Although they manage to chase Il Duce away , the three men suffer serious wounds , the most serious being the loss of Rocco s finger . The three return to a safehouse where they cauterize each other s wounds . Hours later as the police conduct an investigation at the crime scene , the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia . However , Smecker happens upon the part of the finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation to see who was behind the gun battle . Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies . This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario , and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men , or join them in their cause , as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers ' actions . After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest , Smecker decides to help the trio . Later , the brothers and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family , but Smecker learns they are walking into a trap . The brothers are captured , and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe , but the brothers are able to free themselves . As Papa Joe leaves his house , Smecker arrives in drag and kills a number of soldiers before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce . As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco , Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire . However , he instead finishes the prayer - revealing he is the brothers ' father and deciding to join his two sons in their mission . Three months later , Papa Joe is sent to trial for a third time . However , the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal . The brothers and Il Duce , aided by Smecker , infiltrate the trial after sliding their weapons over the metal detector . Unmasked , they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and killing Papa Joe . The media dubs the three as the Saints , and the movie ends with various candid interviews with the public , reflecting on the question Are the Saints ultimately good ... or evil ?
