In 1967 , a pregnant woman is attacked by a vampire while giving birth . Doctors are able to save her baby , but the woman dies of infection . Thirty-one years later , the child has become the vampire hunter Blade . He raids a rave club owned by the vampire Deacon Frost . Police take one of the vampires to the hospital , where he feeds on hematologist Karen Jenson and escapes . Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend Abraham Whistler . Whistler explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses , such as sunlight and silver . As Karen is now marked by the bite of a vampire , both he and Blade tell her to leave the city . Meanwhile , at a meeting of vampire elders , Frost , the leader of a faction of younger vampires , is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans . As Frost and his kind were not born as vampires and are therefore not pure-bloods , they are considered socially inferior . In response , Frost has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority . Upon returning to her apartment , Karen is attacked by a policeman , who is a familiar , a human slave controlled by a vampire . Blade subdues the familiar and uses information from him to locate an archive of vampire history . Later , at the hideout , Blade injects himself with a special serum that prevents him from succumbing to his desire to drink blood , which would ultimately turn him into a vampire . However , the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse . While experimenting with the anticoagulant EDTA as a possible replacement , Karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood . She manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected , but learns that it will not work on a human-vampire hybrid like Blade . Frost and his men attack the hideout , infect Whistler , and abduct Karen . When Blade returns , he helps Whistler commit suicide and arms himself with special syringes filled with EDTA . When Blade attempts to rescue Karen from Frost s penthouse , he finds that his mother is one of Frost s followers . He is subdued and taken to the Temple of Eternal Night , where Frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for La Magra , the vampire blood god . Blade is drained of his blood , but Karen allows him to drink from her , triggering his vampirism . Frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of La Magra . Blade kills all of Frost s minions , including his mother , and confronts him . During their fight , Blade injects Frost with all of the syringes , causing his body to explode . Karen offers to help Blade cure himself , but he asks her to create a new serum instead . In a brief epilogue , Blade kills a group of Russian vampires .
