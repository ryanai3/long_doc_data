Rangers Gabriel Gabe Walker and Jessie Deighan are dispatched to rescue their friend Hal Tucker and his girlfriend Sarah after Hal suffered a knee injury and stranded them on a peak in the Colorado Rockies . As they try to rescue Sarah , part of her harness breaks , and though Gabe is able to grab her , her gloved hand slips out , and she falls to her death . Hal blames Gabe for her death and Gabe is overcome with guilt , taking an extended leave . Eight months later , Gabe returns to the ranger station to gather his remaining possessions and convince Jessie to leave with him . While there , they receive a distress call from a group of stranded climbers . Hal goes to locate the climbers and Jessie is able to convince Gabe to help out . Hal remains bitter towards Gabe over Sarah s death , at one point threatening to send Gabe over a ledge . When they find the climbers , they discover the distress call was a ruse and are taken prisoner by former Military Intelligence operative Eric Qualen and several mercenaries . Qualen , along with turncoat U.S. Treasury agent Richard Travers , were able to steal three suitcases full of uncirculated bills valuing over $ 100 million . Their escape plan backfired , sending their plane crashing into the mountain , and they now require Gabe and Hal s help to locate the cases with the help of beacon locators . At gunpoint , Gabe leads them to the first case , located at the top of a steep rock face . They force Gabe to tether himself to reach it , and Gabe uses the opportunity to escape . The mercenaries attempt to fire on Gabe , which causes an avalanche that kills one of their members . When they see the money from the first case fluttering away , Qualen believes Gabe is dead , and orders Hal to lead them onward . Gabe races ahead to find Jessie at an abandoned cabin . They recover old mountaineering gear to reach the second case before Qualen does . By the time Qualen arrives , Gabe and Jessie have emptied the case and left only a single bill with the taunting message Want to trade ? on it . Qualen orders his men to split up , allowing Gabe to dispatch two more of Qualen s men . Gabe attempts to call for help from Frank , their rescue helicopter pilot , on one of the mercenaries ' radios , but Hal alerts him to explosives Qualen has rigged above them on the mountain . Gabe and Jessie escape the falling debris in time . Elsewhere , when Hal sees two friends , Evan and Brett , he warns them away before Qualen orders his men to open fire . Brett is killed while Evan is wounded , though he manages to ski off the mountain and parachute to safety . Night falls on the mountain and both groups take shelter . Frank , having not heard from Gabe or the others , scouts the mountain in the helicopter , spots Evan s parachute , and is able to get him to safety while contacting the authorities . When morning breaks , Gabe and Jessie beat Qualen to the last case . Meanwhile , the mercenaries flag down Frank in the helicopter , and by the time he realizes it s a trap it is too late . He is shot by one of the mercenaries and dies , but not before slipping Hal a knife . As the mercenaries split up to look for the other case , Hal is able to use the knife to wound one of the mercenaries , kill him with his own gun , and escape . Elsewhere Hal finds Gabe , and together they kill Travers . However , at the same time , Qualen takes Jessie hostage when she waves down the helicopter , believing that Frank was flying it . Qualen tells Gabe and Hal over the radio that he is holding Jessie captive on board the helicopter , demanding Gabe and Hal to surrender the money from the third case at a high elevated rendezvous point and threatens to kill her should they refuse to cooperate . Gabe and Hal agree , and they meet at a cliff side bridge . However , Qualen tries to challenge Gabe into throwing the case into the helicopter , but when he also threatens to kill Jessie again , Gabe orders Qualen to free her at a safe distance away from the cliff . Qualen reluctantly agrees , and uses a winch to lower Jessie to the ground . Once Jessie is safely down , however , Gabe throws the bag of money into the helicopter s rotors , shredding the money . Enraged , Qualen attempts to fly off , but Gabe has used the winch cable to tether the helicopter to a steel ladder up the cliff face . The ladder snaps and leaves Gabe and Qualen atop the wreckage of the helicopter hanging by the cable . Gabe fights Qualen and manages to climb to safety as the wreckage snaps off the cable , sending Qualen to his death . Gabe reunites with Jessie and Hal as federal agents arrive in helicopters to offer their assistance .
