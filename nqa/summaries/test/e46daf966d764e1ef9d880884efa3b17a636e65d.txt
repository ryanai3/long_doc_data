The film revolves around three characters who work in television news . Jane Craig ( Hunter ) is a talented , neurotic producer whose life revolves around her work . Jane s best friend and frequent collaborator , Aaron Altman ( Brooks ) , is a gifted writer and reporter ambitious for on-camera exposure who is secretly in love with Jane . Tom Grunick ( Hurt ) , a local news anchorman who until recently was a sports anchorman , is likeable and telegenic , but lacks news experience and knows that he was only hired for his good looks and charm . He is attracted to Jane , although he is also intimidated by her skills and intensity . All three work out of the Washington D.C. office of a national television network . Craig is drawn to Grunick , but resents his lack of qualifications for his new position as news anchor . Altman also is appalled by Grunick s lack of experience and knowledge , but accepts his advice when finally getting an opportunity to anchor a newscast himself . Unfortunately , he lacks Grunick s poise and composure in that seat , and his debut as an anchor is a resounding failure . Altman acknowledges to Craig that he is in love with her while trying to dissuade her from pursuing a romantic relationship with Grunick . As a massive layoff hits the network , resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs , Altman tenders his resignation , and tells her he plans to take a job in Portland , Oregon . However , before he leaves , he tips off Craig to a breach of ethics on Grunick s part . She decides she can not in good conscience get personally involved with Grunick , who the network is transferring to London . She no longer has either man in her personal or professional life , at least until the three of them reunite several years later .
