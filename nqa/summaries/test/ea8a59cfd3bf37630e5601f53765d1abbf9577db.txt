Although the film centers on Childers , it starts off with a scene in South Sudan , where the LRA are attacking a village . This opening scene is placed into context later in the film . Childers was an alcoholic drug-using biker from Pennsylvania . On his release from prison , he finds that his wife has given up her job as a stripper , because she has since accepted Christ as her savior . One night he almost kills a vagrant . However , the day after that night , his wife persuades him to go to church with her , where he is eventually baptized and offered salvation . He finds a stable job as a construction worker and later starts his own construction gig . Later , on a missionary trip to Uganda to build homes for refugees , he asks one of the SPLA soldiers watching over them to take him on a trip to the north , to Sudan . The soldier warns him that it is a war zone , but upon Sam s insistence they go . They arrive at a medical tent in Sudan . As the soldier moved off to talk to some people , Sam is roped in by a female doctor to help lift a lipless Sudanese woman onto the examination table . That night as they lay on their beds at the relief station , they hear noises outside , and when they look out , Sam and the soldier see large numbers of Sudanese children swarming in to sleep outside the building . The soldier explains that their parents send them to sleep over there because it is safer than staying in their own village . Sam wakes up the children and gets as many as he can to sleep in their room for the night . The next day they follow the children back to their village only to find that the LRA burnt it down and killed their parents . One of the children runs after his dog and is killed by a hidden landmine . Sam then decides to build an orphanage for the children of South Sudan . After the orphanage is built , the LRA attack it under cover of night and burn it to the ground . Sam then phones home , telling his wife what happened and that he is giving up . She reminds him that the orphans have been through worse but they have not given up , and that he should not give up and tells him to rebuild the orphanage . One night after the orphanage has been rebuilt , he and his friends from the SPLA are attacked on the road by the LRA , they manage to chase off the small force of the LRA that attacked them . They search the area and discover a large group of Sudanese children hiding in a ditch not far from the road . Since they can not take all the children in one trip , Sam chooses to take the ones who need medical attention along with a few others on their first trip back to the orphanage . However , upon returning to the spot as quickly as he could , he finds that the LRA killed and burnt those he had left behind . This causes Childers to lead armed raids to rescue children from the LRA . He returns home disgruntled and exasperated about the lack of money for the project . Meanwhile his friend Donnie dies , this pushes him further into negativity . He sells his business and boards plane for Sudan . His faith and mission revitalises when an orphan boy shares his personal story . The boy tells if Sam allows hatred fester in heart , his fight against injustice fails . Sam rekindles his emotional attachment with his family over phone . Next day he involves with the camp actively . Later he goes out with SPLA and rescues a caravan full of children kidnapped by LRA . The end credits include black and white pictures of the real Sam Childers , his wife , daughter , and his orphanage in Sudan .
