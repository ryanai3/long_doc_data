In a futuristic 21st-century era , crop blight on Earth has made farming increasingly difficult and threatens humanity s survival . Joseph Cooper ( McConaughey ) , a widowed former NASA pilot , runs a farm with his father-in-law , son , and daughter Murphy , who believes her bedroom is haunted by a poltergeist . When a pattern is created out of dust on the floor , Cooper realizes that gravity is behind its formation , not a ghost . He interprets the pattern as a set of geographic coordinates formed into binary code . Cooper and Murphy follow them to a secret NASA facility , where they are met by Cooper s former professor Dr . Brand ( Caine ) . Brand reveals that a wormhole mysteriously appeared near Saturn 48 years earlier , opening a pathway to a distant galaxy with potentially habitable planets . Twelve volunteers traveled through it to assess each planet s suitability as humanity s new home , led by Dr. Mann ( Damon ) . Volunteers Miller , Edmunds and Mann have sent back encouraging data from planets near a black hole called Gargantua . Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spaceship Endurance to investigate further , while he works on Plan A â a gravitational theory for propulsion that would allow a mass exodus from Earth . The Endurance also carries 5,000 frozen embryos for the Plan B backup plan , which is to colonize a habitable planet to ensure humanity s survival . Cooper agrees to go , upsetting Murphy . Cooper s crew consists of scientists Romilly , Doyle , Brand s daughter Amelia ( Hathaway ) , and robots TARS and CASE . Traversing the wormhole , they head to Miller s planet , an ocean world where time is severely dilated because of its proximity to Gargantua ; for each hour there , seven years pass on Earth . They find only the wreckage from Miller s expedition . Amelia retrieves Miller s data just before a gigantic tidal wave hits , killing Doyle and water-logging the engines . After returning to Endurance , they discover 23 years have elapsed on Earth . Murphy ( Chastain ) , now an adult , has been assisting Dr . Brand with his research . On his deathbed , he admits to her that Plan A was not feasible â he has known since Endurance departed . He reveals that Plan B was the only plan all along . In a recorded video session Murphy notifies Amelia of her father s death , accusing her and Cooper of abandoning Earth . Believing the equations can be solved , she continues working on a solution to Plan A knowing she needs more data on gravitational singularities . With limited fuel , the crew choose Mann s planet over Edmunds ' as the next stop , since Mann is still transmitting . Once there , Mann assures the crew that the frozen planet is habitable despite its ammonia-laden atmosphere . Then , while out together surveying the planet , Mann attempts to kill Cooper , revealing that he falsified the data in hopes of being rescued . He steals Cooper s ranger and heads for Endurance . Meanwhile , Romilly is killed by a booby trap set by Mann . Amelia rescues Cooper and they race to Endurance in a second lander , where Mann is attempting a dangerous manual docking operation . Mann ignores Cooper s warnings and is killed in the attempt , severely damaging the Endurance in the process . Cooper uses the lander to stabilize the ship . CASE warns Cooper that Endurance is slipping toward Gargantua s pull . Cooper makes a quick decision to use Gargantua as a gravitational slingshot to propel the ship toward Edmunds ' planet , but their proximity to Gargantua means more time will elapse on Earth . To shed weight , Cooper and TARS jettison themselves toward the black hole , so that Amelia and CASE can complete the journey . Slipping past the event horizon , Cooper and TARS find themselves inside a tesseract , which resembles a stream of bookshelves capable of peering into Murphy s bedroom at different periods in her life . Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created to enable communication with Murphy , and that he was her ghost all along . Using the second-hand on the watch he gave her before he left , Cooper relays the quantum data Murphy needs to solve the gravitational equation . Following a turbulent ejection , Cooper awakens in a space habitat orbiting Saturn . He reunites with an aged Murphy nearing death . At Murphy s request , Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Amelia on Edmunds ' habitable planet , where she is preparing a new human colony .
