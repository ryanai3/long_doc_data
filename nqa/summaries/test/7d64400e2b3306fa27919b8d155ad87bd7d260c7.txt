In 1935 , Indiana Jones narrowly escapes the clutches of Lao Che , a crime boss in Shanghai in the Republic of China . With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow , Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that , unknown to them , is owned by Lao . While the three of them sleep on the plane , the pilots parachute out , and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel . Indy , Shorty , and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft , and then riding down the slopes into a raging river . They come to Mayapore , a desolate village in northern India , where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by the Hindu god Shiva and enlist their help to retrieve the sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine , as well as the community s children , from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace . During the journey to Pankot , Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory . The trio receive a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace , Chattar Lal . The visitors are allowed to stay the night as guests , during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young Maharajah , Zalim Singh . Chattar Lal rebuffs Indy s questions about the villagers ' claims and his theory that the ancient Thuggee cult is responsible for their troubles . Later that night , Indy is attacked by an assassin , leading Indy , Willie , and Shorty to believe that something is amiss . They discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie s room and set out to explore them , overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way . The trio eventually reach an underground temple where the Thugs worship the Hindu goddess Kali with human sacrifice . They watch as the Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial fire pit burning him alive . They discover that the Thugs , led by their evil , bloodthirsty high priest Mola Ram are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones , and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones , which they hope will allow them to rule the world . As Indy tries to retrieve the stones , he , Willie , and Shorty are captured and separated . Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali , which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs . Willie , meanwhile , is kept as a human sacrifice , while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children . Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch , shocking him out of the trance . After defeating Chattar Lal , also a Thuggee worshiper , Indy stops Willie s cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire . They go back to the mines to free the children , but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer . The Maharajah , who was also forcibly entranced by the Blood of Kali , attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll . Shorty spars with the Maharajah , ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance . With his strength returned , Indy kills the overseer . The Maharajah then tells Shorty how to get out of the mines . While Mola Ram escapes , Indy and Shorty rescue Willie and retrieve the three Sankara stones , the village children escape . After a mine cart chase to escape the temple , the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river . Using a sword , Indy cuts the rope bridge in half , leaving everyone to hang on for their lives . Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot . Two of the stones fall into the river , while the last falls into Mola Ram s hand , burning him . Indy catches the now-cool stone , while Mola Ram falls into the river below , where he is devoured by a Mugger crocodile . The Thugs then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows , until a company of British Indian Army riflemen from Pankot arrive , having been summoned by the palace Maharajah . In the ensuing firefight , many of the Thuggee archers are killed and the remainder are surrounded and captured . Indy , Willie , and Shorty return victoriously to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers .
