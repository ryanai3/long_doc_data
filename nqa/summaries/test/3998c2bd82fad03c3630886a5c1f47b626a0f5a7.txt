In 1941 , SS colonel Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier La Padite as to the whereabouts of the last unaccounted-for Jewish family in the area . In exchange for the Germans agreeing to leave his family alone for the rest of the war , La Padite reveals that the Dreyfus family is hidden under the floor . Landa orders SS soldiers to shoot through the floorboards . The family is killed except for Shosanna , a young woman who escapes . Three years later , Lieutenant Aldo Raine of the First Special Service Force recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the Basterds , who spread fear among the German soldiers by killing and scalping them . The Basterds also recruit Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz , a German soldier who murdered thirteen Gestapo officers . Adolf Hitler interviews a German soldier , Private Butz , the only survivor of a Basterd attack on his squad . Raine carved the letter T into Butz s forehead with a knife so he could never hide that he voted for an avowed fascist . Shosanna is operating a cinema in Paris under an assumed name . She meets Fredrick Zoller , a German sniper who killed 250 soldiers in a single battle ; Zoller is to star in a Nazi propaganda film , Stolz der Nation ( Nation s Pride ) . Infatuated with Shosanna , Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere of the film at her cinema . Shosanna plots with her projectionist and lover , Marcel , to kill the Nazi leaders attending the premiere by setting the cinema ablaze . Unknown to Shosanna , British Army Lieutenant Archie Hicox is working with the Basterds to plan an attack on the same premiere . Hicox goes to a tavern with Hugo Stiglitz and Basterd Wilhelm Wicki to meet an undercover agent , the German film star Bridget von Hammersmark . Hicox gives himself away by ordering three drinks and gesturing three with his hand ( with thumb and pinky finger down ) ; Gestapo Major Dieter Hellstrom knows that Germans gesture three with the thumb and first two fingers extended . Discovered , and the Basterds open fire , killing everyone in the tavern except Wilhelm and a wounded Hammersmark . Raine arrives and negotiates with Wilhelm for Hammersmark s release , but the she kills Wilhelm when he lowers his guard . Raine learns from Hammersmark that Hitler himself will be attending the film premiere and decides to continue the mission . Later , Landa investigates the aftermath at the tavern and finds one of Hammersmark s shoes and a napkin with her signature . At the premiere , two of the Basterds , Donny Donowitz and Omar Ulmer , join Raine in posing as Italians , hoping to fool the Germans unfamiliar with the language . However , Landa , who speaks fluent Italian , converses briefly with the Basterds before sending Donowitz and Ulmer to their seats . He takes Hammersmark to a private room , verifies that the shoe from the tavern fits her , then strangles her to death . Raine and another of his men , Smithson The Little Man Utivich , are taken prisoner , but Landa has Raine contact his superior with the OSS and cuts a deal : he will allow the mission to proceed in exchange for immunity and rewards . During the screening , Zoller slips away to the projection room to see Shosanna . After she rejects his advances , he becomes aggressive . She pretends to acquiesce , then pulls a pistol from her bag and shoots him . Zoller , mortally wounded , raises his pistol and shoots her before they both die . As Stolz der Nation reaches its climax , spliced-in footage of Shosanna tells the audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew . Marcel , having locked the doors of the cinema , ignites a pile of flammable nitrate film behind the screen as Shosanna s image laughs . Ulmer and Donowitz break into the box containing Hitler and Goebbels , killing them , then fire their submachine guns into the crowd until the bombs go off , killing everyone in the theater . Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory , where they surrender . Raine shoots the radio operator and carves a swastika into Landa s forehead .
