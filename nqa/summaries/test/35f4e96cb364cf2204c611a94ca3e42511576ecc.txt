In the mid 22nd century , mankind has reached a point in technological advancement that enables colonization of the far reaches of the universe . Armed with artificially intelligent Thermostellar Triggering Devices , the scout ship Dark Star and its crew have been alone in space for 20 years on a mission to destroy unstable planets which might threaten future colonization of other planets . The ship s crew consists of Lt. Doolittle ( helmsman , and initially , second-in-command ) , Sgt . Pinback ( bombardier ) , Cpl . Boiler ( navigator ) , and Talby ( target specialist ) . Dark Star Commander Powell was killed during hyperdrive as a result of an electrical short behind his rear seat panel , but remains onboard ship in a state of cryogenic suspension . The crew members perform their jobs with abject boredom , as the tedium of their tasks over 20 years has driven them around the bend . The Dark Star ship is in a constant state of deterioration and frequent system malfunctions ( for example , a radiation leak which is not repairable , their cargo of intelligent talking bombs lowering from their bomb bay without a command to do so , an explosion destroying their sleeping quarters , the food processing computer repeatedly serving chicken-flavored liquid meals , and a storage bay self destructing and destroying the ship s entire supply of toilet paper ) , and only the soft-spoken female voice of the ship s computer for company . They have created distractions for themselves : Doolittle , formerly a surfer from Malibu , California , has constructed a musical bottle organ ; Talby spends his time in the ship s observation dome , content to watch the universe go by ; Boiler obsessively trims his moustache , enjoys smoking cigars , and shoots targets with the ship s emergency laser rifle in a corridor ; while Pinback plays practical jokes on the crew members , maintains a video diary , and has adopted a ship s mascot in the form of a mischievous beachball -like alien who refuses to stay in a storage room , forcing Pinback to chase it around the ship . With regard to Pinback , he may not actually be Sgt . Pinback at all ; in his video diary , he states he is liquid fuel specialist Bill Froug , who inadvertently took the real Sgt . Pinback s place on the mission . It is unclear , however , whether or not this is a paranoid illusory fiction Sgt Pinback has created , due to his prolonged time working in deep space . En route to their next target ( the Veil Nebula ) , the Dark Star is hit by a bolt of electromagnetic energy during a storm , resulting in yet another on-board malfunction , with Thermostellar Bomb # 20 receiving an order to deploy . With some difficulty , the ship s computer convinces Bomb # 20 that the order was in error , and persuades the bomb to disarm itself and return to the bomb bay . Talby notes the malfunction , and decides to investigate the fault ( to the complete disinterest of his crew mates ) , and discovers a damaged communications laser in the emergency airlock while the crew is engaging their next bombing run . While attempting to repair it the laser malfunctions , blinding Talby and knocking him unconscious , inadvertently triggering a more serious problem , causing extensive damage to the ship s main computer , and damaging the bomb release mechanism on Bomb # 20 . Due to the damaged ship s computer , the crew members discover that they can not activate the release mechanism and attempt to abort the drop . To make matters worse , after two prior accidental deployments , and intent on exploding as it was programmed to do , Bomb # 20 refuses to disarm or abort the countdown sequence . As Pinback and Boiler try to talk the bomb out of blowing up underneath the ship , Doolittle revives Commander Powell , who advises him to talk to the bomb , and to teach the bomb the rudiments of phenomenology . After donning a space suit and exiting the ship to approach the bomb directly , Doolittle engages in a philosophical conversation with Bomb # 20 until it decides to abort its countdown and retreat to the bomb bay for further contemplation . Disaster appears to have been averted , but when attempting to re-enter the ship , Doolittle inadvertently jettisons Talby out of the airlock . As Doolittle tries to rescue the now-conscious Talby as he floats away from the Dark Star , Pinback addresses the bomb over the intercom in another attempt to disarm it . Unfortunately , Doolittle has mistakenly taught the bomb Cartesian doubt and , as a result , Bomb # 20 determines that it can only trust itself and not external input . Convinced that only it exists , and that its sole purpose in life is to explode , Bomb # 20 states Let there be light , and promptly detonates . Pinback and Boiler are killed instantly . Commander Powell is jettisoned into space encased in ice , and Talby and Doolittle are blown in opposite trajectories , drifting away from each other . Talby drifts into the Phoenix Asteroids ( a cluster of glowing asteroids he has long had a fascination with ) , destined to circumnavigate the universe for eternity . As Doolittle loses contact with Talby , he sees that he is falling toward the unstable planet . Realizing he will burn in the atmosphere , he drifts into debris from the Dark Star , finds an appropriately surfboard-shaped hunk of debris , and surfs down into the atmosphere of the planet , dying as a falling star .
