Travis Bickle , a 26-year-old honorably discharged U.S. Marine , is a lonely , depressed young man living on his own in New York City . He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia , driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City . He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary . Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy , a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine . After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window , Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her , and takes her out for coffee . On a later date , he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film , which offends her , and she goes home alone . His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed , so he berates her at the campaign office , before being kicked out by Tom . Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts , which are beginning to turn violent , but Wizard assures him that he will be fine , leaving Travis to his own destructive path . Travis is disgusted by the sleaze , dysfunction , and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city , and attempts to find an outlet for his frustrations by beginning a program of intense physical training . A fellow taxi driver refers Travis to illegal gun dealer Easy Andy , from whom he buys a number of handguns . At home , Travis practices drawing his weapons and constructs a sleeve gun to hide and then quickly deploy a gun from his sleeve . One night , Travis enters a convenience store moments before an attempted armed robbery and he shoots and kills the robber . The shop owner takes responsibility for the shooting , taking Travis ' handgun . On another night , teenage prostitute Iris enters Travis s cab , attempting to escape her pimp Matthew Sport Higgins . Sport drags Iris from the cab and throws Travis a crumpled twenty-dollar bill , which continually reminds him of her and the corruption that surrounds him . Some time later , Travis hires Iris , but instead of having sex with her , attempts to dissuade her from continuing in prostitution . He fails to completely turn her from her course , but she does agree to meet with him for breakfast the next day . Travis leaves a letter to Iris at his apartment saying he will soon be dead , with money for her to return home . After shaving his head into a mohawk , Travis attends a public rally , where he plans to assassinate Senator Palantine , but Secret Service agents notice him with his hand in his coat and chase him . He flees and later goes to the East Village to invade Sport s brothel . A violent gunfight ensues and Travis kills Sport , a bouncer , and a mafioso . Travis is severely injured with multiple gunshot wounds . Iris witnesses the fight and is hysterical with fear , pleading with Travis to stop the killing . After the gunfight , Travis attempts suicide , but has run out of ammunition and resigns himself to lying on a sofa until police arrive . When they do , he places his index finger against his temple gesturing the act of shooting himself . Travis , after having recovered from his wounds and returning to work , receives a letter from Iris ' father thanking him for saving her life and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh , where she is going to school . Later , he reconciles with Betsy after dropping her off at home in his cab . When she tries to pay her fare , Travis simply smiles at her and drives away . In the final shot , Travis looks in the rearview mirror and suddenly becomes agitated .
