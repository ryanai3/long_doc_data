Basquiat as a biopic , a requiem even ; ( director Julian Schnabel talking to Charlie Rose 9th August 1996 ) is a labour of love , where the big name stars worked for scale ' and the recording artists gave masters and publishing rights at unheard of ' rates . The movie experience makes equal room to emphasize the soundtrack . It begins as the credits roll with the back of a little boy and his mum walking down a corridor then arrive in front of Picasso s Guernica . A grown-up dreadlocked Basquiat comes out of a cardboard box in the bushes behind a graffiti-ised park seat . As he walks NY he sky becomes a massive wave a surfer is riding . He gets thrown out of a cafe but makes friends with Gina , the waitress ; then he visits his vague mum in an institution to tell her he s getting married ; his love is obvious wheras the marriage is not . He catches up with Gina on the street and asks her to come to Mudd Club and she says he can call her . Theyre now sleeping together . When his park box bed collapses in the rain at night he visits Benny and they snort and get high . A prank call to a suicide line then set to music at the Mudd Club where he sees Gina through the crowd . They leave ; he cant flag a cab so with a look to her she steps to the front and she can . While in a gallery working with an electrician painter he walks out after being bossed around by the owner , then peers into the art show opening . He s the SAMO graffitist . Surfing superimposition As Benny and him are walking talking , a limo draws up and as they watch Andy Warhol and Bruno ( art dealer ) get out ; Basquiat goes into the restaurant theyre in and sells them two of his postcards . He s painting inside with black and white tv on when Gina wakes up and she loses her block ; he s painted her dress and paintings but he comforts her back to happiness . Snorting at a high-rise drug den where some of them check out passers-by with a telescope which is used to find him after he s left for Rene who runs down in admiration of his talent . Sure enough , the art shows , dealers and gallery owners start to be fixtures in his life . People are now coming by all the time while he paints and after he flirts with big pink ' in the street he s nodding off then being slapped around to wake him up by Gina who sees a needle on the bedside table . Benny is noticing a change in Basquiat s attitude with his new found art world niche and storms out the taxi . The arty-fartyness of it all is coming out as dealers and gallery owners fight for him and his work and he gains in admiration from limosine drivers . Rene loses his block at Mr Chou s after an exhibition opening and is forcibly removed . His positive nature shoes through being interviewed by a rather condesceding amateur reporter . Bicycling around , visiting Andy who is now his friend . He and Gina catch up at a posh restaurant where a table of businessmen snigger and he checks his drug face blotches in the mirror . Andy relays that the gossip is Basquiat is killing himself but doesnt like the idea of him going to Hawaii and opening a tequilla shop ; because Basquiat is a painter . Basquiat sends Andy a dreadlock helmet . Basquiat walking down the street , tries to join in with some graffiti-ists who take offence and bash him up . More surf scenes – and blackness Basquiat walks into a studio where paintings are being hung ; the owner sees him and the artist being hung – Milo -invites him to visit and tells him Andy does care , does know about art , and is concerned about Basquiat s drug habit . After Bruno tells Basquiat about Andy s death there s waterskiing footage with Basquiat writing TITA on what could be a skull or baseball … and footage of the real Andy and the acted Andy watched by Basquiat as tears start to come . He tries to get his mum out of the convent in the middle of the night , then Benny finds him in his pjs and they drive through NY in an old jeep ; we see his clogs are what he was painting : TITANIC . We hear him tell a story his mother used to tell him about a prince locked in a tower who couldnt get out and would bang his crowned head on the window bars to no avail ; but the sound of the crown on the metal bars created the most beautiful sound for miles around . It filled everything and everyone up with beauty . Let s go to Ireland he says , stop in every pub and have a drink . The next screen gives his birthdate and that he died on August 12 , 1988 at 27 years . The movie is dedicated to Joe Glasgo 1925-96 who discovered Schnabel the director . While characters have been created for the movie story , so many elements – such as the crown – encourage further interest in Jean-Michel Basquiat .
