In 2006 , Brooklyn Congressman David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the United States Senate . While rehearsing his concession speech , David meets Elise Sellas . They share a passionate kiss , though he does not get her name . Inspired by her , David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received , making him a favorite for the 2010 race . A month later , David prepares for a new job . At Madison Square Park , near David s home , a man named Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from Richardson , his boss : ensure David spills coffee on his shirt by 7:05 AM so he misses his bus . Mitchell falls asleep and misses David , who encounters Elise on the bus and gets her phone number . David arrives at work to find his friend Charlie Traynor frozen in time and being examined by unfamiliar men . David attempts to escape , but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse . Richardson explains he and his men are from the Adjustment Bureau . They ensure people s lives proceed as determined by the Plan , a complex document Richardson attributes to the Chairman . The Bureau confiscates and destroys the note that contains Elise s phone number , and David is warned that if he reveals the existence of the Bureau to anyone else , he will be reset âakin to being lobotomized . He is not meant to meet Elise again . Three years later , after boarding a bus , David encounters Elise ; he tells her he spent three years riding that bus to work , hoping to see her . He learns that she dances for Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet . The Bureau tries to stop him from renewing their relationship by altering their schedules . David races across town , fighting the Bureau s abilities to control his choices to ensure he will meet Elise . During the chase the Bureau uses ordinary doorways to travel instantly to distant locations . Senior official Thompson takes over David s adjustment and takes him to the warehouse , where David argues he has the right to choose his own path . Thompson says humanity received free will after the height of the Roman Empire , but then brought the Dark Ages upon itself . The Bureau took control after five centuries of barbarism , and created the Renaissance , the Enlightenment , and the scientific revolution ; when free will was granted in 1910 it resulted in World War I , the Great Depression , Fascism , the Holocaust and the Cuban Missile Crisis , forcing the Bureau to retake control . Thompson implies that without Elise s influence David might become President of the United States , and warns that if he stays with her , he will ruin their futures . Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle at a performance to demonstrate his power , and David abandons her at the hospital to save them from the fate Thompson described . Eleven months later , Charlie tells David of Elise s imminent wedding as he campaigns again . Harry contacts David via secret meetings in the rain or near water , which prevents the Bureau from tracking them . Harry reveals that Thompson exaggerated the negative consequences of David and Elise s relationship , and teaches David how to use doors to teleport and evade the Bureau s adjustments . Just before the wedding David reaches Elise , reveals the Bureau s existence to her , and shows her how he travels through doors . The Bureau pursues them across New York City . David decides to find the Chairman to end the chase , with Elise accompanying him . They enter the Bureau s offices with agents in pursuit . David and Elise find themselves surrounded on the observation deck of the GE Building . They declare their love and kiss before David can be reset . When they let go of each other , the Bureau members have gone . Thompson appears but is interrupted by Harry , who shows him a revised Plan from the Chairman : one that is blank starting from the current moment . Harry commends them for their devotion to each other , then says they are free to leave . David and Elise walk down the street as Harry speculates that the Chairman s goal may be to prepare humanity to write its own Plans .
