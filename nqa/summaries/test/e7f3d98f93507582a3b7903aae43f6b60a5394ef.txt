In the 26th century , humanity has left an overpopulated Earth to colonize a new solar system . The central planets formed the Alliance and won a war against the outer planet Independentsâthose refusing to join the Alliance . River Tam ( Summer Glau ) is coercively conditioned by Alliance scientists into a psychic assassin . She is rescued by her brother Simon ( Sean Maher ) . During her training , River inadvertently read the minds of several officers and learned top government secrets . Consequently , a top Alliance agent known only as the Operative ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) is tasked with recapturing her . The siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship Serenity with Captain Malcolm Mal Reynolds ( Nathan Fillion ) , first mate Zoe Washburne ( Gina Torres ) , pilot Hoban Wash Washburne ( Alan Tudyk ) , mercenary Jayne Cobb ( Adam Baldwin ) , and mechanic Kaylee Frye ( Jewel Staite ) . Despite Simon s objections , Mal brings River on a bank robbery where they are attacked by savage and cannibalistic Reavers . They escape , but Simon decides he and River will leave Serenity at the next port . Once there , however , a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons , and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship . The crew contacts reclusive hacker Mr. Universe ( David Krumholtz ) , who discovers a subliminal message designed to trigger River s mental conditioning . He notes River whispered Miranda before attacking and warns that someone else saw the footage . Mal is invited to visit Inara Serra ( Morena Baccarin ) , a former Serenity occupant . Despite knowing she is held hostage as a trap , Mal goes to rescue her . The Operative confronts Mal , promising to let him go free if he turns over River . Mal refuses and escapes with Inara . River reveals that Miranda is a planet located beyond a region of space swarming with Reavers . The crew flies to the planet Haven to ponder their next move . They find Haven devastated and their old friend , Shepherd Book ( Ron Glass ) , mortally wounded . The Operative claims responsibility for the killings . He promises to keep pursuing them and killing anyone who assists them until he captures River . Despite the crew s objection , Mal disguises Serenity as a Reaver ship and travels to Miranda . On the planet , the crew find all its colonists dead and a recording by the last surviving member of an Alliance survey team ( Sarah Paulson ) . She explains that an experimental chemical designed to suppress aggression was added into Miranda s air . Most residents became so docile they stopped performing all activities of daily living and allowed themselves to die . A small portion of the population had the opposite reaction and became exceedingly aggressive and violent , turning into Reavers . Mr. Universe agrees to broadcast the recording , luring the crew to the Operative . However , the Operative mortally wounds him , destroys his transmitting equipment , and prepares an ambush . Though Mal suspects a trap , he must deliver broadcast the recording . On the way , they provoke the Reaver fleet into pursuing them . While the Reaver fleet clashes with the waiting Alliance fleet , Serenity crash lands near the broadcast tower . Wash is killed by Reavers shortly after . The crew make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to broadcast the recording . Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe before his death , Mal learns of a backup transmitter . Sustaining heavy injuries , the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close . A Reaver shoots through the opening and severely wounds Simon , prompting River to dive through the doors and close them as the Reavers drag her away . At the backup transmitter , Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording . Mal returns to the crew , and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers . Alliance troops reach the group , but the Operative orders them to stand down . The Operative provides medical aid and resources to repair Serenity . The Operative tells Mal the broadcast has weakened the Alliance government . While he will try to convince the Parliament that River and Simon are no longer threats , he can not guarantee the Alliance will end their pursuit . Serenity takes off with River as Mal s co-pilot .
