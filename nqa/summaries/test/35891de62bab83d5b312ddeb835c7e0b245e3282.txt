The film opens with criminal Dean Keaton lying badly wounded on a ship docked in the San Pedro Bay . He is confronted by a mysterious figure whom he calls Keyser , who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship , The bloodbath on the ship leaves only two survivors : Arkosh Kovash , a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns ; and Roger Verbal Kint , a con artist with cerebral palsy . Customs agent Dave Kujan flies in from New York City to interrogate Verbal , who describes in flashback the events that led him and four other criminals - Keaton , Michael McManus , Fred Fenster and Todd Hockney - onto the ship . Verbal explains that , six weeks earlier in New York , he and the other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped-up hijacking charge , and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police . Led by Keaton , a former corrupt policeman , they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy . They then went to California to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named Redfoot . Redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist , but the quarry turned out to be heroin , and the five had to shoot their way out . Soon after , a lawyer named Kobayashi contacted them and told them that Keyser Söze , a Turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen ( including Hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in New York ) , had offered them a job : invade a ship manned by a gang of Argentinian drug dealers with whom Söze was competing and destroy the $ 91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting . When Kujan learns of Söze from FBI agent Jack Baer , he questions Verbal about him . Verbal tells Kujan an underworld legend about Söze : that he had murdered his own family after they had been attacked by a gang of Hungarian criminals , and then massacred the Hungarians and everyone they held dear . He then went underground , never to be seen again , and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working . He became a fearsome urban legend , a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night . Verbal goes on to explain that , after Fenster had bailed on the group , Kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot s dead body . They tried to kill Kobayashi , but he strong-armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones . They staked out the ship and killed several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters , but found no drugs on board . McManus , Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person , who also killed Keaton and set the ship on fire as Verbal looked on . Verbal concludes his story , but Kujan does not believe it . He insists that Keaton must be Söze , as one of the murder victims on the boat was Arturo Marquez , a drug dealer who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify Söze — and who was represented by Edie Finneran , Keaton s lawyer and girlfriend . Kujan claims that the Argentinians were selling Marquez to Söze s Hungarian rivals and Keaton used the heist as a distraction to let him kill Marquez . Kujan also informs Verbal that Finneran has been murdered . Verbal says that the entire plan was Keaton s idea , but refuses to testify in court . Verbal s bond is posted and he is released . Moments later , Kujan realizes that Verbal s entire story was a lie , pieced together from details on a crowded bulletin board in his office . Meanwhile , Verbal walks outside , gradually dropping his limp and flexing his supposedly withered hand . As Kujan runs after Verbal , a fax comes in from California : a police sketch artist s rendering of Söze , dictated by Kovash , that looks exactly like Verbal . Kujan misses Verbal by moments , as the latter disappears into a car driven by Kobayashi .
