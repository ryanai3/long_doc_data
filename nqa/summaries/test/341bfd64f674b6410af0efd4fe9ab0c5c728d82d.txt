Billionaire media mogul William Bill Parrish is considering a merger between his company and another media giant , while also about to celebrate his 65th birthday with an elaborate party being planned by his eldest daughter Allison . He begins to hear mysterious voices , which he tries with increasing difficulty to ignore . His youngest daughter Susan , an internal medicine resident , is involved with one of Bill s board members , Drew . She is considering marriage , but her father can tell she s not passionately in love . When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech , he simply says , Stay open . Who knows ? Lightning could strike ! Susan meets a vibrant young man at a coffee shop . She is instantly enamored but fails to even get his name . Minutes after their encounter ( but unbeknownst to her ) , the man is struck by multiple cars in what appears to be a fatal motor vehicle accident . Death arrives at Bill s home in the body of the young man , explaining that Bill s impassioned speech has piqued his interest . Given Bill s competence , experience , and wisdom , Death says that for as long as Bill will be his guide on Earth , he will not have to die . Making up a name on the spot , Death is introduced to the family as Joe Black . Bill s best efforts to navigate the next few daysâknowing them now to be his lastâfail to keep events from going rapidly out of his control . Drew is secretly conspiring with a man bidding for Parrish Communications . He capitalizes on Bill s strange behavior and unexplained reliance on Joe Black to convince the board to vote him out as Chairman , using information given to him inadvertently by Bill s son-in-law , Quince , to push through approval for the merger which Bill had decided to oppose . Quince is devastated . Although confused by the sudden reappearance of Joe , believing him to be the young man from the coffee shop , Susan eventually falls deeply in love with him . Joe is now under the influence of human desires and becomes attracted to her as well . Bill angrily confronts him about his relationship with his daughter , but Death ( personified in Joe ) declares his intention to take Susan with him for his own . As his last birthday arrives , Bill appeals to Joe to recognize the meaning of true love and all it encompassesâespecially honesty and sacrifice . Joe comes to understand that he must set aside his own desire and allow Susan to live her life . He also helps Bill regain control of his company , exposing Drew s underhanded business dealings to the board by revealing himself to be an agent of the Internal Revenue Service and threatening to put Drew in jail . Bill devotes his remaining hours of life to his daughters at the party . Joe says a last goodbye to Susan , who seems to finally sense his true purpose and identity . As fireworks appear in the distance , Susan watches as Joe and her father walk out of view . Bill expresses to Joe , trepidation ; but Joe assures him that in this future ( while it may be unknown to him ) , he has nothing to fear . After a few moments ( with both her father and Joe now gone ) , Joe reappears , alone . Death appears to have departed ( with Bill ) , leaving Susan s young man from the coffee shop , unaware of how he got to Susan s father s party . While Susan ( in this new reality s timeline ) , is now both aware of ( and accepting ) , that her father has gone ; and she welcomingly reignites the mutual bonding with the man she had met in the coffee shop ( and who had disappeared ; a few days earlier ) . During their conversation , there are hints to the audience whether or not the man is truly the young man from the coffee shop , or is it really still Death . Susan asks , What do we do now ? ( A question that took place between her and Death/Joe earlier on ) . The man replies with , It will come to us . They both hold hands and look out , watching the fireworks at its end .
