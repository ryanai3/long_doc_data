Prior to a new hotel opening on Amity Island , an enormous great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing the wreck of the Orca , the late Quint s boat . A couple of days later , their camera is recovered , and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver , devouring the skier while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun , causing the boat to explode , which kills her and severely burns the shark s face . Along with these disappearances , a killer whale bearing large wounds is beached . Police Chief Martin Brody believes these events are the work of a shark . Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn , who doubts the town has another shark problem . Later , Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach . He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver s burnt remains . The following day , at the beach , Brody sees a dark shadow that approaches the swimmers . Thinking it is a shark , he frantically orders everyone out of the water and causes a panic by firing his gun . However , the shadow is revealed to be a school of bluefish , making people think Brody s insane . His fears are later confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver s camera . The Amity town council , including local developer Len Peterson , deny the evidence and vote Brody out as Police Chief . The next morning , Brody s teenage son Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends after his love interest Jackie Peters goads him to , but his younger brother Sean catches him and encourages Mike to bring him along . After an argument at the dock , Marge , one of Mike s friends , playfully lets Sean come in her boat with her , and after a couple other grouping arrangements , they head out , going past a team of divers , led by instructor Tom Andrews . Moments after going underwater , one of the divers encounters the shark . Panicking , he rushes to the surface , causing an embolism . Soon after , the shark hits teenagers Tina Wilcox and Eddie Marchand ; Eddie falls in the water and is killed by the shark . Brody and his wife Ellen follow an ambulance to the docks , where they find Tom as he is put on a stretcher ; the divers suspect something scared him underwater . Deputy Len Hendricks , Brody s replacement , tells them Mike went sailing with his friends , so Brody , along with Ellen and Hendricks , takes the police boat to rescue them . While searching , they come across Tina s boat , and find her hiding in the bow ; she fearfully mentions the shark s presence . Hendricks and Ellen take Tina to shore , where the truth is revealed , while Brody goes on to find the kids . Meanwhile , the shark attacks the other kids , hitting one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize and crash into each other in the ensuing panic , throwing several of them , including Mike and Sean , in the water . The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help . Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats . A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore . Before the pilot can tow them , the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls . It then knocks Sean into the water , but Marge sacrifices herself to save him . Brody runs into Mike , who tells his father that Sean is with his friends , drifting towards Cable Junction , a small island housing an electrical relay station , and apologizes for not knowing about the shark . Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them , but when the shark reappears , he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction . He then tries to pull them with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable . The shark s next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water , and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats . Using an inflatable raft , Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark and encourages it to bite the cable ; the shark is fatally electrocuted , and its corpse sinks to the bottom of the sea . The shaken kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue .
