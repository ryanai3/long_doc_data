Bruce Nolan ( Jim Carrey ) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo , New York , but desires to be the news anchorman . He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly ( Jennifer Aniston ) , but also has a mild crush on his co-worker , Susan Ortega ( Catherine Bell ) , who barely seems to notice him . Bruce , however , suffers from constant bad luck , and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival , Evan Baxter ( Steve Carell ) , who then steals dialogue from Bruce s segment while accepting the promotion on-air . Furious , Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report , and is promptly fired . Following a series of other misfortunes , Bruce takes out his frustration on God ( Morgan Freeman ) , blaming Him and claiming that He is the one who should be fired . Bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse , where he meets God . God offers to give Bruce His powers , to prove that He is doing His job correctly . God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow : firstly , Bruce can not tell anyone else that he has God s powers ; and secondly , Bruce can not use the powers to interfere with free will . Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers , using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog , exposing a woman by blowing up her dress , transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7 , and sexually impressing Grace . Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers , such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa s body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off , earning him his job back . Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on-air , causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor . After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor ( angering her , as she thought he was going to propose ) , Bruce begins to hear voices in his head . He re-encounters God , who confronts Bruce about his selfish use of his powers . He explains that the voices are prayers to God , and that Bruce must deal with them . Bruce creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond , but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle — even though God had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area — and sets the program to automatically answer Yes to every prayer . During a party to celebrate Bruce s promotion , Susan seduces and kisses him . When Grace arrives and sees this , she storms out ; Bruce follows her , but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him . He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay , but can not influence her free will . As Bruce looks around , he realizes that automatically granting everyone s prayers has plunged the city into chaos . Bruce returns to God , who explains that despite how chaotic things seem , there is always a way to make things right , and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself . Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically , such as helping a man whose car has broken down , training his dog normally , and allowing Evan to have his job back . Bruce returns to his computer system , having briefly unplugged it , and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can . As he reads through them , he finds a prayer from Grace , wishing for Bruce s success and well-being . As he reads it , another prayer from Grace arrives , this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore . A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway , asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands . Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void . God appears and asks Bruce what he really wants ; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy . God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital , shortly after being revived — near miraculously — by the doctors . Grace arrives and the two rekindle their relationship , later becoming engaged . After his recovery , Bruce returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories . Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live TV . The film ends with the doomsayer Bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be God .
