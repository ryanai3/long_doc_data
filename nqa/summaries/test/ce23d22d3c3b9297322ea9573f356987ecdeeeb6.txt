Fugitive bank robbers and brothers Seth and Richie Gecko are fleeing the F.B.I . and Texas police . During the first few minutes of the film , they hold up and destroy a liquor store , killing the clerk and a cop . Two witnesses they held hostage in the store escape during the shooting . They still hold a bank clerk hostage in the trunk of their car , whom Richie later rapes and murders . The Fuller family — Jacob , the father and a pastor who is experiencing a crisis of faith ; his son Scott ; and daughter Kate — are on a vacation in their RV . They stop at a motel and are promptly kidnapped by the Geckos , who force the Fullers to smuggle them past the Mexican border . Seth and Jacob make an uneasy truce : if the Geckos can make it past the border , Jacob and his family will come out of the ordeal unharmed . They arrive at the Titty Twister , a strip club in the middle of a desolate part of Mexico , where the Geckos will be met by their contact Carlos at dawn . The Geckos demand that the Fullers have a drink with them before leaving , despite Kate s obvious discomfort . Soon after entering the club , chaos ensues as the employees and strippers are all revealed to be vampires . Most of the patrons are quickly killed , and Richie is bitten by the star stripper , Santanico Pandemonium , and bleeds to death . Only Seth , Jacob , Kate , Scott , a biker named Sex Machine and Frost , a Vietnam War veteran , survive the attack . The slain patrons — including Richie — then come back to life as vampires , forcing Seth to kill his own brother . During this second struggle , one of the vampires bites Sex Machine in the arm . Subsequently , Sex Machine changes into a vampire and bites Frost and Jacob before Frost throws Sex Machine through the door , which allows an army of vampires to enter as bats from the outside . Seth and the Fullers desperately escape to a back storeroom and fashion anti-vampire weapons from items found therein , including a pneumatic drill , crossbow , shotgun , and holy water , which requires Jacob to recover his faith to bless . Jacob , knowing he will soon turn into a vampire , makes a reluctant Scott and Kate promise to kill him when he changes . The four make their final assault on the undead . Jacob changes , but Scott hesitates to dispatch his father , allowing Jacob to bite Scott . Scott hits Jacob with holy water and shoots him . Scott is captured by several vampires who begin to devour him . Begging for death , Scott is shot by Kate . Only Seth and Kate survive , surrounded by vampires . Just as they contemplate suicide , streams of sunlight shine through new holes in the walls , making the vampires back away . Dawn has come , and Carlos is trying to shoot his way in . On Seth s call , Carlos ' bodyguards blast open the door , letting in full sunlight and killing every vampire inside . Carlos admits that he had never entered the club , but that he had thought it looked like a fun place . Kate asks Seth if she can go with him to El Rey , Mexico , but he declines , saying , I may be a bastard , but I m not a fucking bastard . They go their separate ways after Seth gives Kate some cash . As they leave , the camera pans back to reveal that the Titty Twister was actually the top of a partially buried ancient Aztec temple , presumably the home of vampires for centuries , and that hundreds of trucks and bikes have been toppled down the side of the cliff .
