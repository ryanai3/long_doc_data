Infuriated at being told to write one final column after being laid off from her newspaper job , Ann Mitchell ( Barbara Stanwyck ) prints a letter from a fictional unemployed John Doe threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society s ills . When the letter causes a sensation among readers , and the paper s competition suspects a fraud and starts to investigate , editor Henry Connell ( James Gleason ) is persuaded to rehire Mitchell , who schemes to boost the newspaper s sales by exploiting the fictional John Doe . From a number of derelicts who show up at the paper claiming to have written the original letter , Mitchell and Connell hire John Willoughby ( Gary Cooper ) , a former baseball player and tramp in need of money to repair his injured arm ( by Bonesetter Brown ) , to play the role of John Doe . Mitchell starts to pen a series of articles in Doe s name , elaborating on the original letter s ideas of society s disregard for people in need . Willoughby gets $ 50 , a new suit of clothes , and a plush hotel suite with his tramp friend The Colonel ( Walter Brennan ) , who launches into an extended diatribe against the heelots , lots of heels who incessantly focus on getting money from others . Proposing to take Doe national via the radio , Mitchell is given $ 100 a week by the newspaper s publisher , D. B. Norton ( Edward Arnold ) , to write radio speeches for Willoughby . Meanwhile , Willoughby is offered a $ 5,000 bribe from a rival newspaper to admit the whole thing was a publicity stunt , but ultimately turns it down and delivers the speech Mitchell has written for him instead . Afterward , feeling conflicted , he runs away , riding the rails with the Colonel until they reach Millsville . John Doe is recognized at a diner and brought to City Hall , where he s met by Bert Hanson ( Regis Toomey ) , who explains how he was inspired by Doe s words to start a John Doe club with his neighbors . The John Doe philosophy spreads across the country , developing into a broad grassroots movement whose simple slogan is , Be a better neighbor . However , Norton secretly plans to channel support for Doe into support for his own national political ambitions . When a John Doe rally is scheduled , with John Doe clubs from throughout the country in attendance , Norton instructs Mitchell to write a speech for Willoughby in which he announces the foundation of a new political party and endorses Norton as its presidential candidate . On the night of the rally , Willoughby , who has come to believe in the John Doe philosophy himself , learns of Norton s treachery from a drunken Connell . He denounces Norton and tries to expose the plot at the rally , but Norton speaks first , exposing Doe as a fake and claiming to have been deceived , like everyone else , by the staff of the newspaper . Despondent at letting his now-angry followers down , Willoughby plans to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the City Hall on Christmas Eve , as indicated in the original John Doe letter . Mitchell , who has fallen in love with Willoughby , desperately tries to talk him out of jumping ( saying another John Doe has already died for the sake of humanity ) , and Hanson and his neighbors tell him of their plan to restart their John Doe club . Convinced not to kill himself , Willoughby leaves , carrying a fainted Mitchell in his arms , and Connell turns to Norton and says , There you are , Norton ! The people ! Try and lick that !
