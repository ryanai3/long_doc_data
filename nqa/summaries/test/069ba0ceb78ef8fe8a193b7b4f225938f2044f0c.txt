In 1996 , psychopathic career criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a number of hostages and takes refuge with his gang in an abandoned building . LAPD Sgt . John Spartan uses a thermal scan of the building and finds no trace of the hostages , and leads an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix . When he is captured , Phoenix sets off a series of explosives that bring down the building , and when the police search the wreckage , they find the corpses of the hostages . Spartan is charged with manslaughter , and he is incarcerated along with Phoenix in the city s new California Cryo-Penitentiary , where they will be cryogenically frozen . During their time in deep freeze , they are to be rehabilitated through subconscious conditioning . During their incarceration , the Great Earthquake leads the cities of Los Angeles , San Diego , and Santa Barbara to merge into a single metropolis under the name San Angeles . The city becomes a utopia run under the pseudo-pacifist guidance and control of the evangelistic Dr. Raymond Cocteau , where human behavior is tightly controlled . In 2032 , Phoenix is woken for a parole hearing , but he finds he somehow knows the access codes to the security systems , and is able to escape the prison and begins wreaking havoc on the city . The police , having not dealt with violent crime for many years , are unable to handle Phoenix and opt to wake Spartan and enlist his help . Spartan is assigned to Lieutenant Lenina Huxley to help with acclimation to the future , which he finds depressing . Others on the police force find his behavior brutish and uncivilized , though Huxley , who is fascinated by the lifestyles of the late 20th century , helps Spartan to overcome this , and the two grow close , despite the limitations on displays of public affection . They attempt to stop Phoenix from stealing 20th century weapons from a museum display , but Phoenix manages to escape . Phoenix encounters Dr. Cocteau during his escape , and though he tries to shoot him , finds himself unable to do so . Dr. Cocteau calmly asks Phoenix to assassinate Edgar Friendly , the leader of the resistance group called the Scraps that fight against Cocteau s rule , and allows Phoenix to bring other criminals out of cryo-sleep to help at his request . Meanwhile , Spartan and Huxley review the cryo-prison records and find that instead of the normal rehabilitation program , Phoenix had been given the information necessary for his escape by Cocteau directly . They also discover information directing Phoenix towards Friendly , and go off to warn him . At the Scraps ' underground base , Friendly is initially distrustful but Spartan is able to convince him of the threat and takes sympathy in their cause given what he has seen above ground . When Phoenix and his gang attack , Spartan and the Scraps ward off the attack , leading to a car chase between Spartan and Phoenix . During the chase , Phoenix taunts Spartan by revealing that he had killed the hostages before Spartan had arrived in 1996 . Phoenix escapes while Spartan comes to terms that he had been wrongly charged with the crime . Meanwhile , Friendly and the Scraps work with the police to try to help stop Phoenix and his gang of cryo-cons . Phoenix returns to Dr. Cocteau with his gang , and as the rehabilitation programming prevents him from killing Cocteau , orders one of his gang to do so . Spartan and Huxley arrive soon after , finding that Phoenix has already left to release more prisoners . Spartan enters the prison alone to fight Phoenix , engages in a violent fight that ravages the facility , and eventually uses the cryogenic chemical to freeze Phoenix before shattering him . Spartan escapes the prison before it explodes and regroups with the police and the Scraps . The police fear the loss of Cocteau will send their society into a downward spiral , but Spartan suggests that they and the Scraps work together to recreate a society that returns some of the personal freedoms that were lost . He then kisses Huxley and the two go off together .
