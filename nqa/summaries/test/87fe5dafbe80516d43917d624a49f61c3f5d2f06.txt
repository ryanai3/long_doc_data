In the distant future , the transport ship Hunter-Gratzner passes a desert planet with its crew and passengers in cryostasis . The passengers consist of nomadic settlers who are relocating to other planets , a Muslim priest who goes by the title Imam , accompanied by young pilgrims traveling to New Mecca , a boy named Jack , a pair of prospectors named Shazza and Zeke , a merchant named Paris , and a law enforcement officer , William J. Johns , who is transporting a notorious criminal , Richard B. Riddick . Riddick has surgically-modified eyes that allow him to see in the dark . Debris ruptures the hull , killing several passengers including the captain . The surviving crew members , docking pilot Carolyn Fry and co-pilot Greg Owens , attempt to land the ship on the nearby planet . As the ship ruptures and falls apart , Fry is forced to jettison sections of the ship . Fry attempts to dump the passenger section of the ship to reduce their weight , but Owens prevents her . During the crash landing , several passenger compartments are destroyed and Owens sustains fatal injuries . The group explore their surroundings . Riddick escapes and Johns warns everyone that he may kill them all . They notice that the three suns surrounding the planet keep it in perpetual daylight . Zeke goes missing and while searching for him , Fry escapes from photosensitive aggressive underground creatures . They find an abandoned geological research settlement , with a dropship with drained batteries . Inside the settlement , one of the young pilgrims is killed by the creatures . An orrery shows that an eclipse is imminent and that the creatures will be free to hunt above ground . Riddick rejoins the group and they return to the crash site to retrieve the power cells to power the dropship . Riddick reveals that Johns is not actually a law officer , but a bounty hunter who is attempting to collect the bounty on Riddick . The group reaches the wreckage , but the eclipse begins before they can return to the settlement . The creatures pour out of the ground and kill Shazza and another of the children . The group decides to salvage any light source that they can and attempts to return to the dropship . Riddick agrees to lead them . En route Riddick reveals that Jack is actually a girl and the scent of her menstrual blood is attracting the creatures . Johns suggests to Riddick that he kill Jack and use her corpse as bait to keep the creatures off the rest of the group . Riddick instead wounds Johns , who is attacked by the creatures , providing a distraction . Fry , Jack , Riddick and Imam make it to a cave near the ship after a rain puts out their flares . Riddick seals them in the cave and takes the power cells . Fry leaves the cave and finds Riddick powering up the ship to leave without them . She pleads with him to help her rescue Imam and Jack , but instead he offers to take her with him . Riddick has a change of heart and they retrieve Imam and Jack and take them to the ship , but Riddick is separated from the group and is wounded by the predators . Fry returns to help Riddick but she is killed after finding him . Riddick makes it to the ship and waits until the last moment before engaging the engines to incinerate as many creatures as possible . In orbit , Riddick tells Jack to tell anyone they meet that Riddick died on the planet below , and they depart for New Mecca .
