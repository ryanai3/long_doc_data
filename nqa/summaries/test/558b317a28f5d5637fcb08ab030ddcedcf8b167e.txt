David Stephens ( Christopher Eccleston ) , a chartered accountant , Juliet Miller ( Kerry Fox ) , a physician , and Alex Law ( Ewan McGregor ) , a journalist , share a flat in Edinburgh . Needing a new flatmate , they interview several applicants in a calculatedly cruel manner to amuse themselves at the applicants ' distress before finally offering the room to the mysterious Hugo ( Keith Allen ) . Shortly after Hugo moves in , the trio find him dead in his room , with a large suitcase full of money . They agree to keep Hugo s death a secret and keep the money for themselves . They agree to bury the body in the woods after removing the hands and feet to prevent identification should it be found . They draw lots and David is given the gruesome and traumatising task of dismembering the corpse , with Juliet disposing of the parts in her hospital s incinerator . Unknown to the three friends , Hugo is being sought by a pair of violent men who are torturing and murdering informants as they follow Hugo s trail . The flat below Alex , David , and Juliet s is broken into , causing them much apprehension and anxiety . The break-in also draws the attention of the police , who are surprised when the three deny that they ever had a fourth flatmate . While Juliet and Alex spend part of the money to feel better ' , David s fears explode into full-blown paranoia . He hides the suitcase of money in the attic , and begins living there , drilling holes in the attic floor to watch the living space below . The relationship between the three becomes increasingly strained and distrustful , with undertones of sexual tension and rivalry . The men trailing Hugo break into the trio s flat and violently assault Alex and Juliet , until they reveal where the money is . As they each enter the dark attic , David , who has been lying there in wait , kills them with a hammer . David alone visits the same woods to dispose of the two bodies . Alex and Juliet become more worried than ever about David s mental state and David becomes worried that the two are conspiring against him . Meanwhile , the police are already circling , in the form of Detective Inspector McCall ( Ken Stott ) and Detective constable Mitchell ( John Hodge ) . Juliet secretly buys a plane ticket to South America in anticipation of flight overseas , but also seduces David to get at the money . Matters come to a head after the bodies are discovered by chanceâthe grave having been too shallowâand Alex is sent by his newspaper to cover the story . He returns to find Juliet and David have reached an understanding about their shared plans that excludes him . That night , Alex , now fearing for his life , tries to secretly phone the police inspector in charge of the case , but he is interrupted by David and Juliet leaving . The doorstep altercation quickly escalates into a murderous triangular fight . David reveals he knows Juliet s secret plan to betray them and attacks her . In the scuffle , David stabs Alex in the chest but is killed by Juliet before he can finish Alex off . With David dead , Juliet tells Alex he ca n't come with her . She then forces the knife even deeper into Alex s torso , pinning him to the floor , before fleeing to the airport with the suitcase of money . However , arriving at the airport , she discovers that she has been tricked : the suitcase is filled not with money but with hundreds of headline clippings about the triple grave taken from Alex s newspaper . Devastated , with no possessions except her plane ticket , and knowing that she will soon be wanted for murder , Juliet flees the country . The police arrive at the flat to find Alex bleeding heavily and pinned to the floor . The camera pans to under the floor to reveal Alex had hidden the missing bundles of cash under the floorboards .
