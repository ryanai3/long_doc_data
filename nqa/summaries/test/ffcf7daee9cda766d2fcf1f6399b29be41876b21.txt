A woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator J. J . Jake Gittes to surveil her husband , Hollis Mulwray , chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power . Gittes tails him , hears him publicly oppose the creation of a new reservoir , and shoots photographs of him with a young woman , which are published on the front page of the following day s paper . Back at his office , Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray , and that he can expect a lawsuit . Realizing he was set up , Gittes assumes that Mulwray s husband is the real target . Before he can question him , Lieutenant Lou Escobar fishes Mulwray , drowned , from a freshwater reservoir . Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray , Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that , although huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night , the land is almost dry . Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman , who slashes Gittes s nose . Back at his office , Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions , who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray . She is afraid to identify her employer , but tells Gittes to check the day s obituaries . Gittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of his wife s wealthy father , Noah Cross . Over lunch at his personal club , Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work , and offers to double Gittes s fee to search for Mulwray s missing mistress . At the hall of records , Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has changed ownership . Investigating the valley , he is attacked by angry landowners , who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply . Gittes deduces that the water department is drying the land so it can be bought at a reduced price , and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan . He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley s new landowners , and seemingly purchased the property a week after his death . Evelyn and Gittes bluff their way into the home and confirm that the real estate deals are surreptitiously completed in the names of its residents . After fleeing Mulvihill and his thugs , Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn s house and sleep together . Early in the morning , Evelyn has to leave suddenly ; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous . Gittes follows her car to a house , where he spies her through the windows comforting Mulwray s mistress . He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman against her will , but she confesses that she is her sister . The next day , an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions s apartment ; he finds her murdered and Escobar waiting for his arrival . Escobar tells him the coroner s report found salt water in Mulwray s lungs , indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir . Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder and tells Gittes to produce her quickly . At Evelyn s mansion , Gittes finds her servants packing her things . He realizes her garden pond is salt water and discovers a pair of bifocals in it . He confronts Evelyn about her sister ; after Gittes slaps her , she admits that the woman , Katherine , is her sister and her daughter : her father raped her when she was fifteen . She says that the eyeglasses are not Mulwray s , as he did not wear bifocals . Gittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler s home in Chinatown . He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal . Cross admits his intention to annex the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles , then irrigate and develop it . Gittes accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray . Cross takes the bifocals and he and his men force Gittes at gunpoint to drive them to the women . When they reach the Chinatown address , the police are already there and detain Gittes . When Cross approaches Katherine , Evelyn shoots him in the arm and drives away with Katherine . The police open fire , killing Evelyn . Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away , while Escobar orders Gittes released . Lawrence Walsh , one of Gittes s associates , tells him : Forget it , Jake . It s Chinatown .
