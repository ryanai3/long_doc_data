Seattle teenager Andrew Detmer starts videotaping his life ; his mother Karen is dying of cancer and his alcoholic father Richard , a former firefighter , is verbally and physically abusive . At school , Andrew is frequently bullied . Andrew s cousin Matt Garetty invites him to a party to help him meet people , but Andrew s filming causes an altercation with an attendee and he leaves disappointed . He is persuaded by popular student Steve Montgomery to record something strange that he and Matt have found in the woods . The trio enter a hole in the ground , where they hear a loud strange noise and discover a large glowing blue crystalline object which turns red , and gives them painful nosebleeds . As the crystalline object begins to react violently , the camera cuts out . Weeks later , Andrew , Matt , and Steve record themselves as they display telekinetic abilities , but begin bleeding from their noses when they overexert themselves . They develop a close friendship and begin using their abilities to play pranks , but when Andrew telekinetically pushes a rude motorist off the road and into a river , Matt insists that they restrict the use of their powers , particularly against living things . When they discover flight abilities , they agree to fly around the world together after graduation . Andrew wants to visit Tibet because of its peaceful nature . Steve encourages him to enter the school talent show to gain popularity . Andrew amazes his fellow students by disguising his powers as an impressive magic act . After the show , Andrew , Matt and Steve celebrate at a house party where Andrew becomes the center of attention . After drinking with his classmate Monica , she and Andrew go upstairs to have sex , but he vomits on her , humiliating themselves . Andrew becomes increasingly withdrawn and aggressive , culminating when his father Richard attacks him and Andrew uses his powers to overwhelm him . His outburst is so extreme that it inflicts psychically connected nosebleeds on Steve and Matt . While Matt ignores the nosebleed , Steve flies up to Andrew in the middle of a storm and tries to console him . However , Andrew grows increasingly frustrated , and Steve is suddenly struck by a lightning bolt and killed . At Steve s funeral , Matt confronts Andrew about the suspicious circumstances of Steve s death . Andrew denies responsibility to Matt , but he privately begs for forgiveness at Steve s grave . Andrew grows distant from Matt and again finds himself ostracized at school . After being bullied , he uses his powers to tear teeth out of a bully s mouth . Andrew begins to identify himself as an apex predator , rationalizing that he should not feel guilt for using his powers to hurt those weaker than himself . When his mother s condition deteriorates , Andrew uses his powers to steal money for her medicine . After mugging a local gang , he robs a gas station where he inadvertently causes an explosion that puts him in the hospital with significant burns , and under police investigation . At his bedside , his father informs the unconscious Andrew that his mother has died , and he angrily blames Andrew for her death . As his father is about to strike him , Andrew awakens and the wall of his hospital room explodes . At a birthday party , Matt experiences a nosebleed and senses Andrew is in trouble . He and his girlfriend , Casey , go to the hospital , where Andrew is floating outside . After saving Richard when Andrew attempts to kill him , Matt confronts his cousin at the Space Needle and tries to reason with him , but Andrew grows hostile and irrational at any perceived attempt to control him . Andrew attacks Matt and the pair fight across the city , crashing through buildings and hurling vehicles . Enraged and fully insane , albeit heavily injured , Andrew uses his powers to destroy the buildings around him , threatening hundreds of lives . Unable to get through to Andrew and left with no other choice , Matt telekinetically impales Andrew with a spear from a nearby statue . The police surround Matt , but he flies away . Later , Matt lands in Tibet with Andrew s camera . Speaking to the camera while addressing Andrew , Matt tearfully vows to use his powers for good and to find out what happened to them in the hole . He positions the camera to view a Tibetan monastery in the distance before flying away , leaving the camera behind .
