On January 5 , 1900 in London , four friends arrive for a dinner at the house of their friend H. George Wells ( Rod Taylor ) , an inventor . Bedraggled and exhausted , George arrives and begins to describe the strange experiences he has had since the group last met . At their earlier dinner , on December 31 , 1899 , George describes time as the fourth dimension to David Filby ( Alan Young ) , Dr. Philip Hillyer ( Sebastian Cabot ) , Anthony Bridewell ( Tom Helmore ) , and Walter Kemp ( Whit Bissell ) . He shows them a small model of his time machine and asks a guest to press a tiny lever . The device disappears , validating his claim , but his friends remain unconvinced ; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal . George bids his guests a good evening , then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits . He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future . He meets Filby s son , James , who tells him of Filby s death in the Great War . Saddened , he resumes his journey , stopping in 1940 during The Blitz , finding himself in the midst of a new war ; George resumes his journey and stops in 1966 , finding his neighbourhood now part of a futuristic metropolis . People are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens . An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover , but he does not understand the danger . A nuclear explosion causes a sudden volcanic eruption around him . George continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens , trapping him inside . He travels far into the future until the topography changes . Hundreds of thousands of years later , the rock erodes away to reveal that London is now gone , and has been replaced by a lush , green and unspoilt landscape . George stops in AD 802,701 near the base of a towering sphinx . He goes exploring and finds a group of delicate young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream . One woman , carried off by the current , screams for help but none of her companions show any concern . George rescues her and is surprised when , revived , she walks away without a word ; later , she seeks him out , giving him a flower . She says her name is Weena ( Yvette Mimieux ) and tells George her people are called the Eloi . He soon learns the Eloi do not operate machines , work , read , and know virtually nothing of history ; they do not even understand fire . George decides to leave but discovers his machine has been dragged into the sphinx . Weena tells him Morlocks , who only come out at night , have moved it . A Morlock jumps out from behind bushes and tries to drag her away , but the creature s light-sensitive eyes are blinded by George s fire torch ; he easily rescues her . The next day , Weena shows George domed , well-like structures that dot the landscape ; they are air shafts that double as access to the Morlock underworld . She takes him to an ancient museum where talking rings tell of a centuries-long nuclear war in the distant past . A reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape ; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements , while some decided to return to the surface . George realises this marked the beginning of speciation for the Morlocks and the Eloi . He starts to climb down a shaft but turns back when sirens blare from atop the sphinx . He emerges to find Weena gone and crowds of Eloi in a trance-like state , entering open doors at its base . The sirens stop and the doors close , trapping Weena inside . George enters the Morlocks ' subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are the free range livestock for the cannibalistic Morlocks . After finding Weena , he begins fighting the creatures . His efforts inspire other Eloi , who begin to defend themselves . George sets a fire and urges the Eloi to clamber out of the caverns to the surface , where he directs them to gather dry tree branches and drop them down the shafts . Smoke billows out of the shafts , and the subterranean cavern later collapses . The next morning , George finds the sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open . His time machine sits just inside , a trap set by the Morlocks . He enters , the doors close , and he is attacked in the dark . George sends his time machine hurtling into the past , returning to 1900 . It comes to rest on the lawn outside his house , where his story ends . George s friends are again skeptical . He produces Weena s flower and Filby , an amateur botanist , says the species is completely unknown in the 19th century . George bids his guests a good evening . Filby steps out but returns to find George and his machine gone . He notices drag marks where it would be positioned outside the sphinx after returning to the Eloi . Filby and Wells ' housekeeper notice three books are missing . Filby asks her , Which three would you have taken ? She wonders if George will ever return . He observes that George has all the time in the world .
