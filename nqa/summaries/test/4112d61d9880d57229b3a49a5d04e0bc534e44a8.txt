Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School , a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn . Dennis Broadway , a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him , writing the number 187 ( the California police code for homicide ) on every page in a textbook . The administration ignores the threat , and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway , stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv . Fifteen months after surviving , Garfield , now a substitute teacher , has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles , but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects , including a Chicano tag crew by the name of Kappin ' Off Suckers ( K.O.S. ) . Their leader , Benito Benny Chacón , a felon attending high school as a condition of probation , makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect . The tension mounts when a fellow teacher , Ellen Henry , confides that Benny has threatened her life , an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action , fearing legal threats . After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood , he disappears , and Benny s unstable tag partner , César , takes over as leader . When César steals Garfield s family heirloom watch , the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action . Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship , but is stymied by Garfield s destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield s past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress , an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school . The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S . escalates with the killing of Jack , Ellen s dog . César , after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog , is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow . He passes out , and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off . César recovers the finger and it is reattached , with the letters R U DUN ( are you done ? ) tattooed as a warning . A student Garfield has tutored , Rita Martínez , a Chicana , faces abuse from both the K.O.S . and Childress , and drops out . The school administration is mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene . After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River , apparently of a drug overdose , it is revealed that Garfield took matters into his own hands , killing Benny and severing César s finger . Garfield lets Ellen leave as she disavows his actions . The K.O.S . plan to murder Garfield . At Garfield s house , the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with César . The latter s resolve is shaken as Garfield talks about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led . Hesitating at his turn , César watches as Garfield , offering to take his turn for him , takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head . Driven by his sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends , César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself . On graduation day , Rita , who completes her studies along with former K.O.S . member Stevie , offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him . The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory and Ellen leaves the school .
