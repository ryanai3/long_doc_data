In Los Angeles in November 2019 , ex-police officer Rick Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) is detained by officer Gaff ( Edward James Olmos ) and brought to his former supervisor , Bryant ( M. Emmet Walsh ) . Deckard , whose job as a Blade Runner was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and retire ( a euphemism for killing ) them , is informed that four have come to Earth illegally . As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models , they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives . Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering the Voight-Kampff test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions . The test subject , Leon ( Brion James ) , shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon s mother . Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three replicants : Roy Batty ( Rutger Hauer ) , Zhora ( Joanna Cassidy ) , and Pris ( Daryl Hannah ) . Deckard initially refuses , but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him , he reluctantly agrees . Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models . While there , he discovers that Dr. Eldon Tyrell s ( Joe Turkel ) assistant Rachael ( Sean Young ) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human . Rachael has been given false memories to provide an emotional cushion . As a result , a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant . Events are then set into motion that pit Deckard s search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives . Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of J.F . Sebastian ( William Sanderson ) , a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell . Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo , but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell s niece , she leaves his apartment in tears . Meanwhile , Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust . While searching Leon s hotel room , Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works . Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also retire Rachael , who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation . After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd , he is attacked by Leon , but Rachael kills Leon using Deckard s dropped pistol . The two return to Deckard s apartment , and during an intimate discussion , he promises not to hunt her ; as she abruptly tries to leave , Deckard physically restrains her , forcing her to kiss him . Arriving at Sebastian s apartment , Roy tells Pris the others are dead . Sympathetic to their plight , Sebastian reveals that because of Methuselah Syndrome , a genetic premature aging disorder , his life will also be cut short . Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell s secure penthouse , where Roy demands more life from his maker . Tyrell tells him that it is impossible . Roy confesses that he has done questionable things which Tyrell dismisses , praising Roy s advanced design and accomplishments in his short life . Roy kisses Tyrell , then kills him . Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy , who then rides the elevator down alone . Though not shown , it is implied by Bryant via police radio that Roy also kills Sebastian . Upon entering Sebastian s apartment , Deckard is ambushed by Pris , but he manages to kill her just as Roy returns . As Roy starts to die , he chases Deckard through the building , ending up on the roof . Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof , but misses and is left hanging precariously between buildings . Roy makes the jump with ease , and as Deckard s grip loosens , Roy hoists him onto the roof , saving him . As Roy s life runs out , he delivers a monologue about how his memories will be lost like tears in rain ; Roy dies in front of Deckard , who watches silently . Gaff arrives and shouts across to Deckard , It s too bad she wo n't live , but then again , who does ? Deckard returns to his apartment and finds the door ajar , but Rachael is safe , asleep in his bed . As they leave , Deckard notices a small tin-foil origami unicorn on the floor , a familiar calling card that brings back to him Gaff s final words . Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment block .
