John Hancock ( Will Smith ) is an alcoholic man with superhero powers , including flight , invulnerability , and super-strength . Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current residence of Los Angeles , his activity inadvertently causes millions of dollars in property damage due to his constant intoxication . As a result , he is routinely jeered at the crime scenes . Hancock also ignores court subpoenas from the city of Los Angeles to address the property damage he has caused . When public relations spokesperson Ray Embrey ( Jason Bateman ) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable , he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train . Hancock saves Ray s life , but he causes the train to derail and nearly injures another driver . Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage , but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life . Ray offers to improve Hancock s public image , and Hancock grudgingly accepts . The spokesperson convinces the alcoholic superhero to permit himself to be jailed for outstanding subpoenas so they can show Los Angeles how much the city really needs Hancock . When the crime rate rises after Hancock s incarceration , the superhero is contacted by the Chief of Police . Reluctantly donning a new costume ( which has been provided by Ray ) , Hancock foils a bank robbery , aiding a wounded officer and stops the leader of the robbers , Red Parker ( Eddie Marsan ) from detonating explosive-laden vests attached to the bank hostages . After the rescue , onlookers applaud Hancock for his handling of the bank robbery . The superhero becomes popular once more , as Ray had predicted . He goes out to dinner with Ray and his wife Mary ( Charlize Theron ) , with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior . After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed , Hancock approaches and kisses Mary . At first , she responds passionately , but then turns angry , throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street . Hancock departs , confused at having apparently found another like himself . The next morning , Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary . She warns him to stay away from her and her family , but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions . When she arrives , Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is also apparently immortal . He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins , and she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers . Mary lies and claims that they are brother and sister , which Hancock dismisses , given the nature of the previous night s kiss . Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful , and he departs to tell Ray about her . The exchange results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles , causing significant damage to the area . Ray , downtown in a business meeting , sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock . Ray departs his meeting and arrives home just in time to see Mary land in the backyard , followed closely by Hancock . She then reveals that , although he does n't remember it , Hancock is her husband . The three then quietly go their separate ways . Later that night , Hancock is shot twice in the chest and wounded when he stops a liquor store robbery . After being hospitalized , Mary enters and explains that as each pair of immortals pair up , they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans , growing old and eventually dying . She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries , the result of his normally heroic nature . She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior , which caused his amnesia . In each instance , Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries . The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker , and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration . Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded . Hancock is able to stop two men but suffers additional injuries in the process . When Red attempts to finish Hancock off , Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe . With Mary dying , Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her powers . He make several clumsy leaps away from the hospital , each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return , until he finally is able to fly off into the night . He later takes up residence in New York City . Ray is seen walking with Mary discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner . As gratitude to Ray , Hancock paints Ray s All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to the worldwide advertisement . In a mid-credits scene , Hancock , now living in New York City , confronts a fleeing criminal with the police . Cornered , the man takes a hostage and jeeringly demands Hancock escort him to safety . Hancock turns back and smiles as the credits resume .
