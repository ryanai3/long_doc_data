Adam Lerner is a 27-year-old public radio journalist in Seattle with an artist girlfriend Rachael , of whom his best friend and co-worker Kyle disapproves ; where Kyle is brash and outspoken , Adam is more introverted and mild-mannered . After experiencing harsh pains in his back , Adam learns from his doctor that he has schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma ( a malignant tumor ) in his spine , and must undergo chemotherapy . He sees on the Internet that his chances of survival are fifty-fifty . After Adam reveals his diagnosis , his overbearing mother , Diane , who already cares for her husband Richard suffering from Alzheimer s , wants to move in and care for him . Adam rejects this offer , as Rachael has promised to be the one to take care of him . Rachael , however , is uncomfortable going into the hospital during Adam s chemo treatments and is often late to pick him up , as Adam does n't drive ; she also gets him a retired racing greyhound named Skeletor as a companion animal . Throughout Adam s struggle , Kyle attempts to keep Adam s spirits high , which include helping Adam shave his head prior to chemotherapy and openly using Adam s illness to pick up women . While on a date with one such woman , however , Kyle sees Rachael at an art gallery , kissing another man , and forces her to come clean to Adam ; this proves to be the final straw in their already strained relationship , and Adam breaks up with her for good . Now single , he eventually starts to follow Kyle s lead , and the two use his illness to successfully pick up two women at a bar . Meanwhile , Adam skeptically begins going to a young and inexperienced therapist , Katherine McKay ( Kendrick ) , a PhD candidate doing the clinical aspect of her thesis at the hospital . Although their relationship and sessions have a rocky start , he slowly begins to open up to her about his disease and how it is affecting him . After she gives him a lift home in her car after one of his chemo sessions , the two develop a rapport both in and outside of their sessions , which begins to blur the lines of both their doctor-patient relationship and connection as friends . She helps Adam understand his mother s situation as well , that even though he is the cancer patient , the loved ones feel just as much stress watching someone they care about fight the disease , which helps Adam make steps in repairing the rift between him and his mother . During chemo treatments , Adam also befriends Alan ( Hall ) and Mitch ( Frewer ) , two older cancer patients who are also undergoing chemotherapy . The two offer Adam advice and smoke marijuana with him . After Mitch suddenly dies , Adam s fears of his own potential death and unknown future become more evident . Subsequently , he is informed that his treatment is not working and that he needs to undertake a risky surgery as a last resort . The night before his surgery , Adam has an argument with Kyle and demands to drive Kyle s car because Kyle is drunkâeven though Adam does not have a driver s license . After nearly causing an accident , Adam breaks down and criticizes Kyle for seemingly not taking his illness seriously and using it for his own ends . Adam calls Katherine and tells her that he wishes he had a girlfriend like her , but also says he is tired and just wants it to be over . That night , Adam stays at Kyle s and while in the bathroom washing his hands , he finds a book entitled Facing Cancer Together ' from their first trip to a bookstore where Kyle picked up the shop clerkâit is filled with notes , highlighted paragraphs and turned-down pages , proving to Adam that Kyle does sincerely care about Adam s struggle and has been helping him the best way he knows how , by simply not treating Adam any differently throughout the duration of his illness . The next day when Kyle drops Adam off at the hospital , Adam embraces Kyle for being a good friend and apologizes for what he said the previous night . After Adam says what could be his final farewells to his family , he undergoes his surgery . During the wait , Katherine goes to the waiting room where she inadvertently meets Adam s family and Kyle . After the surgery , Kyle , Diane , and Katherine are told by the doctor that although the bone degradation was worse than they had thought , the tumor was removed successfully , and that Adam would recover . Some time later , Adam is getting ready for a date with Katherine , while Kyle encourages him and cleans the incision on Adam s back from the surgery . The doorbell rings and Adam lets Katherine inside . After Kyle leaves , Katherine asks , Now what ? , and Adam simply smiles - at last being free of cancer .
