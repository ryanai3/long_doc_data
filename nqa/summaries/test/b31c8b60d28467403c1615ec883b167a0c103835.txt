In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when their owners are present , a group of toys owned by a six-year-old boy , Andy Davis ( John Morris ) , are caught off-guard when Andy s birthday party is moved up a week , as Andy , his single mother ( Laurie Metcalf ) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week . The toys ' leader and Andy s favorite toy , an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody ( Tom Hanks ) organizes the other toys , including Bo Peep the shepherdess ( Annie Potts ) , Mr . Potato Head ( Don Rickles ) , Rex the Dinosaur ( Wallace Shawn ) , Hamm the Piggy Bank ( John Ratzenberger ) and Slinky Dog ( Jim Varney ) , into a scouting mission . Green army men , led by Sarge ( R. Lee Ermey ) , spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors . The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced , but then Andy receives a surprise gift â an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear ( Tim Allen ) , who believes that he is an actual space ranger . Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features , and Andy begins to favor him , making Woody feel left out . As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet , his mother allows him to bring only one toy along . Fearing Andy will choose Buzz , Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk , but ends up knocking him out a window instead , resulting in the other toys accusing Woody of murdering Buzz out of jealousy . Before they can exact punishment , Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet . When the family stops for gas , Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well , and the two fight , only to find the family has left without them . They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck , where Buzz , still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody s attempts to convince him otherwise , gets them stuck in a crane game , where they are picked out by Andy s destructive neighbor Sid Phillips ( Erik von Detten ) . Woody attempts to escape from Sid s house , but Buzz , finally discovering he is a toy , sinks into despondence . Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket , but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm . Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy , restoring his confidence . The next morning , Woody and Sid s mutant toy creations rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him . Woody and Buzz then leave Sid s house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home . The duo try to make it to the moving truck , but Sid s dog , Scud , sees them and gives chase . Woody tries rescuing Buzz with Andy s RC car , but the other toys , thinking Woody eliminated RC as well , attack and toss him off the truck . Having evaded Scud , Buzz and RC pick up Woody and continue after the truck . Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC , the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard but RC s batteries become depleted , stranding them . Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz s back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air . Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes , gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van , right next to Andy . On Christmas Day , at their new house , Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals . As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz , they discover Andy s new gift is a puppy , and the two share a worried smile .
