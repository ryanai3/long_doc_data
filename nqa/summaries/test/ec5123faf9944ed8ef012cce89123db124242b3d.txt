In 1280 , King Edward Longshanks ( Patrick McGoohan ) invades and conquers Scotland following the death of Alexander III of Scotland , who left no heir to the throne . Young William Wallace ( James Robinson ) witnesses Longshanks ' treachery , survives the deaths of his father ( Sean Lawlor ) and brother ( Sandy Nelson ) , and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle ( Brian Cox ) , where he is educated . Years later , Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland , including Prima Nocte . Meanwhile , a grown Wallace ( Mel Gibson ) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough ( Catherine McCormack ) , and the two marry in secret . Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers , but as she fights off their second attempt , Murron is captured and publicly executed . In retribution , Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England . Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward ( Peter Hanly ) to stop Wallace by any means necessary . Wallace rebels against the English , and as his legend spreads , hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him . Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York , killing Longshanks ' nephew ( Richard Leaf ) and sending his severed head to the king . Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce ( Angus Macfadyen ) , the son of nobleman Robert the Elder ( Ian Bannen ) and a contender for the Scottish crown . Robert is dominated by his father , who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English . Worried by the threat of the rebellion , Longshanks sends his son s wife Isabella of France ( Sophie Marceau ) to try to negotiate with Wallace . After meeting him in person , Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace . Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella , Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country . Leading the English army himself , Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan ( John Murtagh ) and Mornay ( Alun Armstrong ) betray Wallace , causing the Scots to lose the battle . As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback , he is intercepted by one of the king s lancers , who turns out to be Robert . Remorseful , he gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him . Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal , and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years , assisted by Isabella , with whom he eventually has an affair . Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh , but Robert s father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English . Learning of his treachery , Robert disowns his father . Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace s child . In London , Wallace is brought before an English magistrate ( David Gant ) , tried for high treason , and condemned to public torture and beheading . Even whilst being hanged , drawn and quartered , Wallace refuses to submit to the king . As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman s valor , the magistrate offers him one final chance , asking him only to utter the word , Mercy , and be granted a quick death . Wallace instead shouts , Freedom ! , and the judge orders his death . Moments before being decapitated , Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd , smiling at him . At the same time , Longshanks dies . In 1314 , Robert , now Scotland s king , leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn , where he is to formally accept English rule . As he begins to ride toward the English , he stops and invokes Wallace s memory , imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace . Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English , winning the Scots their freedom .
