In 1940 , Carl Fredricksen is a young 9-year-old boy who idolizes famous explorer Charles Muntz . Muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls , and vows to return there to catch one alive . One day , Carl befriends a girl named Ellie , who is also a fan of Muntz . She confides to Carl her desire to move her clubhouse âan abandoned house in the neighborhoodâto a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls . Carl and Ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house . Carl sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo Ellie opens . After suffering a miscarriage and being told they can not have a child , the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls . They try to save for the trip , but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs . Finally , an elderly Carl arranges for the trip , but Ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies . Years later , Carl still lives in the house , stubbornly holding out as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction , but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox , a court orders him to move to a retirement home . However , Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie , and turns his house into a makeshift airship , using thousands of helium balloons . Russell , a young Wilderness Explorer , becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly . After surviving a thunderstorm , the flying house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls . Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa , hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate . Russell encounters a tall , colorful flightless bird , whom he names Kevin . They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug , who wears a special collar that allows him to speak , and who vows to take the bird to his master . The group is set upon by a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha , a doberman ( who is also seeking the bird ) , and are taken to their master , who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz . Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible , where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird . When Russell notes the bird s similarity to Kevin , Muntz becomes hostile , believing they have been attempting to steal the bird . The pair flees with Kevin and Dug , but Muntz catches up with them , captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl s house , forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin . Carl rushes to put out the fire , allowing Muntz to take the bird . He and Russell eventually reach the falls , though Russell is disappointed in Carl over his decision to abandon Kevin . Settling into his home , Carl looks through Ellie s childhood scrapbook , and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage , along with a note thanking him for the adventure and encouraging him to go have a new one . Reinvigorated , he goes to find Russell , only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save Kevin on his own . Carl empties the house of furniture and possessions , lightening it , and pursues him . Russell is captured by Muntz , but Carl manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both him and Kevin . Dug accidentally defeats Alpha and becomes the dogs ' new leader . Muntz pursues them around the airship , finally cornering Dug , Kevin , and Russell inside Carl s tethered house . Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship with Dug and Russell clinging to her back , but when Muntz leaps after them , he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death . The house then descends out of sight through the clouds . Carl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks , then fly the dirigible back to the city . Carl presents Russell with his final badge : a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met and made their promise . The two and Dug then enjoy some ice cream together . Meanwhile , Carl s house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls , fulfilling his promise to Ellie .
