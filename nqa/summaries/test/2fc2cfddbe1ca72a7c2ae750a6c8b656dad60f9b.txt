In 1937 , a military facility is on watch behind a two-way mirror as a soldier ( Bill Hader ) , smoking marijuana , begins to reveal very graphically what he hates about the army , but still remains euphoric . A high-ranking officer ( James Remar ) immediately closes the project and deems marijuana illegal . Jump ahead seventy years later , Dale Denton ( Seth Rogen ) is a 25-year-old process server and habitual marijuana smoker . He makes a visit to the home of his drug dealer , Saul Silver ( James Franco ) , to buy marijuana . Saul tells him that he may already know the identity of Dale s next customer , Ted Jones ( Gary Cole ) . Dale drives to Ted s house and witnesses Ted and a police officer , Officer Carol Brazier ( Rosie Perez ) , shoot a man to death . Dale panics and flees the area , but leaves his roach at the scene , which contains a rare strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express . Ted is able to identify the strain and sends his two henchmen , Budlofsky and Matheson ( Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson ) to a dealer , Red ( Danny McBride ) , who tells them that he has only sold the pot to Saul . Dale flees to Saul s apartment and learns that Ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach back to Saul . Dale and Saul flee into the nearby woods while Ted s henchmen persuade Red to arrange a meeting with Saul . They accidentally fall asleep in Dale s car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with Red . They leave the woods and arrive at Red s house , hoping to determine whether Ted has linked them with the Pineapple Express . Red says Ted is n't after them but Dale realizes that he s lying , and starts a fight that results in Red getting knocked out . They wake Red and question him until he reveals that Ted has discovered who they are and is going to kill them . Dale and Saul decide that they must leave the city . In order to leave town , Dale and Saul sell some Pineapple Express to raise bus fare . However , a police officer named Barber ( Cleo King ) sees Dale and arrests him for selling marijuana . In the back of the cruiser , Dale tries to convince Barber that Brazier is corrupt and tells her that he witnessed her and Ted murder a man . Barber recognizes Brazier and promises him that she will investigate her soon . However , Saul leaps out in front of the police car and hijacks it thinking that Brazier is the one driving . Brazier hears a police radio call of Dale s arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase but they manage to escape . After an argument with each other about the situation they are in , Dale and Saul go their separate ways . Saul visits his grandmother in an assisted living home but is kidnapped and held hostage in Ted s lair beneath a barn . Dale enlists Red to help him rescue Saul but Red unexpectedly backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured . While Dale and Saul are held hostage , they reconcile with each other and make plans to escape . Suddenly , Asian mobsters attack the barn to avenge a fellow gangster s death at the hands of Ted and Officer Brazier ( the same murder that Dale witnessed ) . Dale and Saul finally free themselves but are caught by Matheson . Matheson grazes Dale s ear with a gunshot but is disarmed and shot by Saul . Dale and Saul join the fight and a brawl ensues between Dale and Ted . When Budlofsky refuses to kill Saul , Matheson emerges from the lair and shoots him in the chest , killing him . He turns around to kill Saul but Red drives through the barn and saves Saul by hitting Matheson with his car . Red is then seemingly shot to death by Brazier . One of the mobsters activate a bomb , resulting in Ted s death , and setting fire to the barn . When Red s car explodes , it flips over and lands on Brazier , killing her . The explosion incapacitates Saul but Dale finds him and carries him out of the burning barn . Red , wounded but still alive , also escapes and reconciles with them . Afterwards they eat breakfast at a diner and talk about their adventure before Saul s grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital .
