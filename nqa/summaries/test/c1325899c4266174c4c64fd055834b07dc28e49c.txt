Gandalf leads Aragorn , Legolas , Gimli , and King Théoden to Isengard where they reunite with Merry and Pippin . With Saruman defeated , Gandalf retrieves Saruman s palantír . Overcome by curiosity , Pippin steals a glance into the seeing-stone , and suffers a mental attack from Sauron himself . Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack Gondor s capital Minas Tirith , so he rides there to warn them , taking Pippin with him because Sauron thinks Pippin is the ring bearer . Meanwhile , Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are led by Gollum to Minas Morgul where they witness the Witch-king of Angmar leading an Orc army to drive Denethor s younger son Faramir and his men from Osgiliath . At Gollum s urging , the three begin climbing a precarious stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a secret way ' . But having overheard Gollum s plot to regain the Ring , Sam keeps a suspicious eye on him . In Gondor , Pippin follows Gandalf s instructions and secretly lights the beacon to signal Théoden to assemble the Rohirrim and come to Gondor s aid . While helping Théoden gather his forces , Aragorn is approached by Elrond who says Arwen is dying . After seeing a vision of her son she refused to leave Middle Earth . Elrond then gives Aragorn the sword Andúril , Isildur s sword Narsil reforged , so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the Dead Men of Dunharrow . Joined by Legolas and Gimli , Aragorn travels to the Paths of the Dead , recruiting the Army of the Dead with the promise to release them from their curse once they fulfil their oath to Isildur . Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath , and believing his son to be dead , Denethor falls into madness . Gandalf is left to command the city defences against the Orc army led by Gothmog . But as Gothmog s forces eventually force their way into the city , Denethor tries to kill himself and Faramir on a pyre . Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir , but Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and the Rohirrim arrive . Initially the Rohirrim have the advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields , but are eventually overwhelmed by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim while the Witch-king mortally wounds Théoden . Though Théoden s niece Éowyn , having posed as a male soldier , battles and slays the Witch-King with Merry s help , Théoden dies of his wounds . Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead , they overcome the Orcs and win the battle . The Dead are released from their curse , and the wounded are tended to . In the Houses of Healing Éowyn meets Faramir , and they comfort each other . Aragorn and the other captains of Men decide to lead all who can march upon the Black Gate as a distraction , so Frodo and Sam can get to Mount Doom . Meanwhile , Gollum manipulates Frodo into leaving Sam behind before they arrive at the tunnel leading to Mordor , and then tricks him into lair of the giant spider Shelob , who paralyses and binds Frodo . Sam arrives and drives Shelob away , but believing his friend to be dead takes Frodo s sword Sting and The One Ring for safekeeping . When he sees Frodo s body being taken by Orcs to Cirith Ungol he realises that Frodo is still alive , and gives chase . Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs , and returns the Ring to him . Aragorn s army draw out Sauron s forces and empty Mordor , allowing the exhausted Hobbits to stagger to the volcano , but they re attacked by Gollum when they reach Mount Doom . Frodo finally succumbs to the Ring s power and claims it as his own , and refuses to destroy it . Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring , but Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum ( while holding the Ring ) into the volcano where the Ring was made . Sam manages to save Frodo . The Ring and Sauron are both destroyed , causing a chain-reaction that consumes the mountain , topples Barad-dûr , and kills most of the fleeing Orcs as the ground crumbles beneath them . Gandalf flies in with eagles to rescue the Hobbits , who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members . Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen . They , and all others present at his coronation , bow before Frodo and the Hobbits . The Hobbits then return to the Shire where Sam marries Rosie Cotton . Frodo , unable to cope with the traumas of his journey , departs Middle Earth for the Grey Havens with his uncle Bilbo , Gandalf , and the Elves , leaving Sam the Red Book of Westmarch which details their adventures . Though saddened by Frodo s departure , Sam is gladdened by the warm welcome he receives upon returning home .
