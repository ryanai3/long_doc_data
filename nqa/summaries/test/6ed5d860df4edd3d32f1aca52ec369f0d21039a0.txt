While clearing out her late husband s safe , she and Longdale found an 8mm film which appears to depict a real murder of a girl , but Mrs. Christian wants to know for certain . After looking through missing persons files , Tom discovers that the girl is Mary Ann Mathews ( Jenny Powell ) , and visits her mother , Janet Mathews ( Amy Morton ) . While searching the house with her permission , he finds Mary Ann s diary , in which she says that she went to Hollywood to become a film star . He asks Mrs. Mathews whether she wants to know the truth , even if it is a horrible truth . She says that she wants to know what happened to her daughter , so after reading the diary and a note left for her mother inside of it , he leaves it for her and then leaves . In Hollywood , with the help of an adult video store employee called Max California ( Joaquin Phoenix ) , Tom penetrates the underworld of illegal pornography . Contact with a sleazy talent scout named Eddie Poole ( James Gandolfini ) leads them to director Dino Velvet ( Peter Stormare ) , whose violent pornographic films star a masked man known as Machine ( Chris Bauer ) . To gain more evidence , Tom pretends to be a client interested in commissioning a hardcore bondage film to be directed by Velvet and starring Machine . Velvet agrees and arranges a meeting in New York City . At the meeting , attorney Longdale appears and explains that Christian had contracted him to procure a snuff film . Longdale says that he told Velvet that Tom might come looking for them . Realizing that the snuff film was authentic , the private eye knows he is at risk . Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten Max , whom they abducted to force Tom to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film . Once he delivers it , but before he turns it over , they kill Max and beat Tom and then burn the film . As they are about to kill Tom , he tells them that Christian had paid $ 1 million for the film and that the reason Christian wanted the film made was for the simple reason that he had enough money to make it possible . Unbeknownst to them previously Velvet , Poole , and Machine received much less and that Longdale kept the major portion . In an ensuing fight , Velvet and Longdale are both killed ; Tom wounds Machine and escapes . He calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police , to which she agrees . Arriving at her estate , Tom is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news . She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Tom : it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading , Try to forget us . Tom decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved . Tracking down Eddie , Tom takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him . Eddie shows no remorse for his role in the murder and taunts Tom for being unable to go through with it . He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her the truth about her daughter s fate and asks a devastated Janet for her permission to punish those responsible , to which she says yes . With that , he returns and pistol whips Eddie to death . After burning his body and the pornography from his car , Tom traces Machine and attacks him at his home . Tom unmasks him , revealing a bald , bespectacled man named George . He says , What did you expect ? A monster ? George goes on to tell Tom that he has no ulterior motive for his sadistic actions ; he does them simply because he enjoys it . They struggle , and Tom kills him . After returning to his family , Tom receives a letter from Mrs. Mathews , thanking him for killing the men responsible and suggesting he and she were the only ones to care about Mary Ann .
