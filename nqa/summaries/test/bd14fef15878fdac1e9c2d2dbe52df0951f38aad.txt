Natalie Cook ( Cameron Diaz ) , Dylan Sanders ( Drew Barrymore ) and Alex Munday ( Lucy Liu ) are the Angels , three intelligent , talented , tough , attractive women who work as private investigators together for an unseen millionaire named Charlie ( voiced by John Forsythe ) . Charlie uses a speaker in his offices to communicate with the Angels , and his assistant Bosley ( Bill Murray ) works with them directly when needed . Charlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox ( Sam Rockwell ) , a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company , Knox Enterprises . Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin ( Tim Curry ) , who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar . The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot the Creepy Thin Man ( Crispin Glover ) who was seen on the surveillance videos during Knox s kidnapping . They chase and fight the Creepy Thin Man , but he runs away . When they follow him , they discover Knox . After the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood ( Kelly Lynch ) , Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Creepy Thin Man has stolen Knox s voice-recognition software . The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters , fool the security system , and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely . They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer . Dylan takes up Knox s offer to spend the night with him , end up in making love but he betrays her later that night , explaining that he faked the kidnapping with help from Vivian and the Creepy Thin Man . He has kidnapped Bosley , and , with access to Redstar s central computer , he intends to use his voice software with the Redstar satellite network to find and kill Charlie , who he believes had killed his father in the Vietnam War . Knox shoots at Dylan , seemingly killing her , but she escapes unharmed . Natalie and Alex are also attacked , and Corwin is murdered by the Creepy Thin Man . When the Angels regroup together , all uninjured , Charlie s offices are blown up . A radio receiver survives in the rubble , and Natalie deduces Bosley s location as he speaks to the Angels using a radio transmitter implanted in his teeth , explaining how to spot his location where he is being held captive . With help from Dylan s current boyfriend The Chad ( Tom Green ) , the Angels approach the abandoned lighthouse where Knox is holding Bosley prisoner . The Angels rescue Bosley and defeat Vivian , the Creepy Thin Man , and some henchmen before Knox blows up the lighthouse , but Knox uses his software and the Redstar satellite network to locate Charlie when he telephones Bosley . When Knox programs a helicopter with a missile towards Charlie s house , Bosley helps the Angels board the helicopter , and Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards , which blows up the helicopter and kills Knox while all of the Angels land safely together on the beach . Seeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person , they enter the beach house that Knox had targeted the missile at , but Charlie has already left . He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker , and treats them and Bosley to a vacation . Charlie tells them that Knox s father was undercover ; however , he was discovered and he was killed by someone else but not Charlie . When he speaks to the Angels unseen again by telephone on the beach , they ask if they could ever meet him in person . Dylan then suspects that she might be seeing him nearby talking into a cell phone , but she does n't tell the group .
