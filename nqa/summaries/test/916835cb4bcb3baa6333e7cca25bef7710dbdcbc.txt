Olive Penderghast , a 17-year-old girl living in Ojai , California lies to her best friend Rhiannon Abernathy about going on a date in order to get out of camping with Rhiannon s hippie parents . Instead , she hangs around the house all weekend listening to Natasha Bedingfield s Pocketful of Sunshine , which is played by a greeting card she was sent . The following Monday , pressed by Rhiannon , Olive lies about losing her virginity to a college guy . Marianne Bryant , a prissy and strictly religious Christian at their school , overhears her telling the lie and soon it spreads like wildfire . The school s conservative church group run by Marianne decides Olive will be their next project . Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon , and he explains how others bully him because of his homosexuality . He later asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him so that he will be accepted by everyone as a straight stud ' . Brandon convinces Olive to help him and they pretend to have sex at a party . After having a fight with Rhiannon over Olive s new identity as a dirty skank , Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp . She begins to wear more provocative clothing and stitches a red A to everything she wears . Boys who usually have had no luck with girls in the past beg Olive to say they have had sex with her in order to increase their own popularity , in exchange for gift cards to various stores , in turn increasing her reputation . Things get worse when Micah , Marianne s 22-year-old boyfriend , contracts chlamydia from sleeping with Mrs. Griffith , the school guidance counsellor , and blames it all on Olive . Olive agrees to lie to cover up the affair so that the marriage of her favorite teacher , Mr. Griffith , would be spared . Marianne s religious clique , which now includes Rhiannon , begins harassing Olive in order to get her to leave school . After an ill-fated date with Anson , a boy who wants to pay her to actually sleep with him and not just pretend she did , Olive reconnects with Todd , her old crush , who is also the school s mascot . Todd then tells her that he does not believe the rumors because he remembers when she lied for him when he was not ready for his first kiss years ago . Olive then begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth , but Brandon and Micah have abruptly left town and everyone else is enjoying their newfound popularity and do not want the truth to get out . Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth and when Olive threatens to expose her , Mrs. Griffith rebuffs her , saying no one would believe her . Olive , out of spite , then immediately tells Mr. Griffith , who believes her and separates from Mrs. Griffith . After a friendly talk with her eccentric , open-minded mother Rosemary , Olive comes up with a plan to get everything finally out in the open . She then does a song and dance number at a school pep rally to get people s attention to watch her via web cam , where she confesses what she has done ( the web cam is the framing device of the film ) . The various boys whose reputations Olive helped improve are also shown watching . Later , Olive texts Rhiannon , apologizing for lying to her . When she is finishing up her web cast , Todd comes by riding a lawnmower and tells her to come outside . She signs off by saying she may lose her virginity to Todd , and proudly declares it s nobody s business ( much to Marianne s disgrace ) . She goes outside to meet him , they kiss and the two are shown riding off on the lawnmower .
