Four years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar , a young girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around on nearby Isla Sorna during a family vacation , and survives an attack by a swarm of Compsognathus . Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen , now headed by John Hammond s nephew , Peter Ludlow , who plans to use Isla Sorna to relieve the company of financial losses . Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion . Hammond explains that Isla Sorna , abandoned years earlier during a hurricane , is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar . Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs , to help rally public support against human interference on the island . After learning that his girlfriend , paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding , is part of the team and is already on the island , Ian agrees to go to Isla Sorna , but only to retrieve her . Ian meets his teammates , Eddie Carr , an equipment specialist and engineer , and Nick Van Owen , a video documentarian . After arriving on the island , they locate Sarah and discover that Ian s daughter , Kelly , had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base . They then watch as an InGen team of mercenaries , hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow arrive to capture several dinosaurs . Meanwhile , team leader Roland Tembo hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant . That night , Ian s team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego . This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs , wreaking havoc upon the camp . Nick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg . After securing Kelly with Eddie , Ian realizes the infant s parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer . As soon as Ian arrives , the infant s parents emerge on both sides of the trailer . The infant is released to the adult T. rexes , which then attack the trailer , pushing it over the edge of a nearby cliff . Eddie soon arrives , but as he tries to pull the trailer back over the edge with an SUV , the adult T. rexes return and devour him . The trailer and the SUV both plummet off the cliff . Ian , Sarah , and Nick are rescued by the InGen team , along with Kelly . With both groups ' communications equipment and vehicles destroyed , they team up to reach the old InGen compound s radio station on foot . The next night , the two adult T. rexes find the group s camp . The female T. rex chases the group to a waterfall cave , while Roland tranquilizes the male . Much of the remaining InGen team is killed by Velociraptors while fleeing through a tall grass savannah . Nick runs ahead to the communications center at the InGen Worker s Village to call for rescue . When Ian , Sarah and Kelly arrive , they are attacked by the raptors . They evade the raptors until a helicopter arrives and transports them off the island . A freighter transports the male T. rex to the mainland , but crashes into the dock after the crew is killed by a creature of unknown species . A guard opens the cargo hold , accidentally releasing the T. rex , which escapes into San Diego and goes on a rampage . Ian and Sarah retrieve the infant T. rex from a secure InGen building and use it to lure the adult back to the ship . Ludlow tries to intervene but is trapped in the cargo hold by the adult T. rex and mauled by the infant . Before the adult can escape again , Sarah tranquilizes it while Ian closes the hold . The T. rexes are escorted back to Isla Sorna , and Hammond says that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a nature preserve , affirming that life will find a way .
