Frankie Ryan works as a page boy at a radio station located in Hollywood . His friend Jeff works in the same place , but as a porter . Their real dream is to perform as radio comedians on the air , with their own show . Unfortunately they have n't convinced anyone about their great sense of humor yet . When they try to help the station receptionist , Anne Mason , by setting up a false audition for the position as singer , they are almost fired for their antics . The station has financial problems related to their current moody singer Rita Wilson , and try to find a way to get rid of her . Their prayers are heard when Rita is shot and killed during a blackout when she is rehearsing for a broadcast . Police detectives Marty Phillips and Delaney arrive at the scene , and even though they have n't found the murder weapon , they start suspecting a wannabe cowboy singer , Tex Barton , who tried to slip out the back door after the shooting . He was in the audience when Rita was rehearsing before the blackout . Station producer Farrell is afraid of being suspected as well , since he had an argument with Rita not long before the shooting . He asks Frankie , who overheard the discussion , to not tell the police about it . As a sign of gratitude , Farrell promises to give Anne a real audition for the position as singer , which is empty since Rita is gone . Frankie soon finds the weapon used to shoot Rita , hidden in a ventilator duct . It turns out the gun belongs to Tex , and has been used in a prior shooting by a woman named Gladys Wharton . When Frankie and Jeff audition for a comedy spot on air ( with Frankie in blackface as a disguise ) , the police come looking for Tex . Later , Tex is found murdered in the office of the station owner . Frankie and Jeff decide to do a little investigation of their own , and search Tex s room to see if they can find anything . The only thing of interest is a picture of Anne , suggesting that her real name is Gladys . Anne is therefore suspected of the murder and arrested by the police . However , a while later she makes bail and is released . Frankie discovers from a radio station in Cheyenne that the shooter Gladys Wharton was a blonde woman who fell for one of her superiors and left her husband - Tex . Since Anne is a true brunette , Frankie concludes that Rita could be Gladys instead of Anne . When all the station executives are gathered in one room by the police , one of them , Van Martin , pulls out a gun and confesses to both crimes . When Jeff enters the room unannounced , he accidentally knocks the gun out of Van s hand and the police arrest him .
