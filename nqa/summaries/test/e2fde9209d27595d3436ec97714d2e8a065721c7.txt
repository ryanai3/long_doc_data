In 2012 , an alien criminal , Boris the Animal , a Boglodite , escapes from a maximum-security prison on the moon and arrives on Earth , bent on taking revenge on Agent K , who shot off his left arm and captured him in 1969 . He confronts K , who is with his partner Agent J , telling him he is already dead . J then discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris , but for deploying the ArcNet , a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction . Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead , J finds that only his memory has been unaffected , and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O , the new Chief , deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum . With K out of the picture , the ArcNet was never deployed , and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion , so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969 , he travels to Coney Island , knowing from the Agency s records that , in 1969 , Boris will commit a murder there . He finds Boris , but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K , who prepares to wipe his memory , but decides at the last minute to investigate J s claims . K and J follow clues , leading them to a bowling alley , and then to The Factory , where they come across an alien named Griffin , who is in possession of the ArcNet . Griffin , who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes , senses Boris is coming and escapes , but he later captures him . J and K pursue and rescue Griffin , acquiring the ArcNet . 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives and they team up . Upon learning that they must go to Cape Canaveral , Florida and attach the ArcNet to the Apollo 11 rocket so it can be deployed in space , J reveals the real purpose of his mission to K , who initially takes the news badly . The three fly there using jetpacks , and are stopped by military police . Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future , convincing him of the importance of their mission , and the officer then assists them in reaching the launch site . As the agents climb up the rocket s launch tower , they are attacked by both 1969 Boris and 2012 Boris . Using his time-travel device , J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges . K shoots off 1969 Boris s left arm ( which restores the timeline ) , knocking him off the tower as well . The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches , with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rocket s exhaust . 1969 Boris then attacks K on the beach , but the colonel pushes K down and out of the way , taking the hit himself instead . K then kills Boris ( which 2012 K had regretted not doing ) instead of arresting him as he originally did . The colonel s young son inquires about his father , but rather than tell him the truth , K wipes his memory and tells him only that his father is a hero . Observing from afar , J realizes that the young boy is himself , the colonel was his father , and that K has actually been watching over him all his life . His mission complete , J returns to 2012 , where he thanks K for being his surrogate father . Meanwhile , Griffin observes the moment and is briefly terrified when K almost forgets to tip a waitress , which sets off a chain of events preventing an asteroid from colliding with Earth .
