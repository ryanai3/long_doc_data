Two years after the events of Blade , a pandemic known as the Reaper virus has spread through the vampire community . Infected vampires are turned into Reapers , mutants immune to all vampire weaknesses with the exception of bright light . Unable to contain the Reapers , vampire lord Eli Damaskinos sends two emissaries , Asad and Nyssa , to seek the aid of vampire hunter Blade and his team , consisting of weaponsmith Abraham Whistler and his assistant Scud . Damaskinos introduces them to the Bloodpack , a group of vampires trained for the sole purpose of killing Blade . In addition to Asad and Nyssa , the Bloodpack consists of Reinhardt , Chupa , Snowman , Verlaine , her lover Lighthammer , and Priest . To keep them in line , Blade plants an explosive charge on the back of Reinhardt s head . On Blade s advice , the team starts by investigating a local nightclub frequented by vampires . When they do encounter Reapers , they soon discover that their weapons and powers are completely ineffective . Blade is forced to kill Priest after he becomes infected , Lighthammer is wounded , Whistler deserts his post , and Scud barely survives a Reaper attack by using UV lights to scare them off . One of the Reapers , Jared Novak , attacks and nearly kills Blade before a burst of sunlight forces him to retreat . Whistler reappears and explains that he has been tracking the Reapers to a central nest in the sewers . Having learned of their prime weakness , he and Scud create UV projectors for the team . While searching for the nest , Lighthammer succumbs to infection , killing Snowman and Verlaine before dying of light exposure . Chupa turns on Whistler and attacks him , only to die when a group of Reapers attracted to his scent tear him apart . Asad is ambushed , dragged underwater , and killed . Using a special UV emitter , Blade kills all of the Reapers with the exception of Novak and rescues Reinhardt and Nyssa , bringing them to Whistler . Damaskinos betrays Blade and Whistler , revealing that he created the Reaper virus in order to create a new race of vampires and that Nomak is in fact his son . Scud turns out to be a familiar loyal to Reinhardt , who also works for Damaskinos . Explaining that he always knew of Scud s true allegiance , Blade kills him with the bomb he placed earlier . Damaskinos then orders his scientists to dissect Blade so that he can learn how to replicate his abilities . After escaping his captors , Whistler brings Blade to a blood vault , where he regains enough strength to kill Reinhardt and his men . Seeking revenge , Nomak tracks Damaskinos to his private heliport and kills him . He then bites Nyssa , infecting her with the virus . Blade confronts Nomak and helps him commit suicide to end his suffering . Fulfilling Nyssa s dying wish , Blade takes her outside , where she dies while watching the sun rise . The movie ends with Blade in London , where he kills Rush , a vampire he encountered earlier in the movie .
