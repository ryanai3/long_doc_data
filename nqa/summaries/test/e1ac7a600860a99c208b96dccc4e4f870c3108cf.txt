A fire starts aboard the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco . The computer launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley , the young girl Newt , Hicks , and the damaged android Bishop ; all four are in cryonic stasis . Scans of the crew s cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the members . The pod crash-lands on Fiorina Fury 161 , a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by male inmates with histories of physical and sexual violence . Inmates recover the pod and its passengers . Ripley is awakened by Clemens , the prison doctor , who informs her that she is the sole survivor . Ripley is warned by the prison warden , Harold Andrews , that her presence may have disruptive effects . Ripley requests that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt , he asks what they are looking for in the body of a girl who had obviously drowned . Ripley tells him that they are investigating a possible case of cholera , while secretly fearing that Newt has been impregnated with an alien embryo . Clemens firmly responds by stating that there has n't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years . The autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found . A funeral is held for Newt and Hicks and their bodies are cremated in the facility furnace . In another section of the prison , an alien bursts out of Spike s chest . The Alien kills several members of the colony and returns outcast prisoner Golic to his deranged state . Ripley re-activates Bishop , who confirms that an Alien came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod . Ripley informs Andrews of her encounters with the Aliens and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it . Andrews does not believe her story , but explains that the facility has no weapons ; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation . The Alien surprises Ripley and Clemens in the prison infirmary and kills Clemens . It examines Ripley , but spares her and retreats . Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary , but he is ambushed and killed by the Alien . Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the Alien . However , the Alien s intervention causes an explosion and several inmates are killed . With Aaron s help , Ripley , who has not been feeling well this whole time , scans herself using the escape pod s medical equipment and discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her . She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the Queen embryo and the adult Alien into biological weapon . Deducing that the Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries , Ripley begs Dillon to kill her ; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the adult creature first . They form a plan to lure the creature into the foundry s molding facility , trap it via a series of closing doors , and drown it in molten lead . The bait-and-chase plan results in the death of every prisoner except Morse and Dillon . Dillon remains in the mold to distract the Alien , allowing it to tear him apart as Morse pours the molten lead onto them . The Alien is covered in molten metal but escapes the mold ; Ripley activates the fire sprinklers , causing the Alien s exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter , killing it . The WeylandâYutani commando team arrives , including a man who looks identical to Bishop and explains that he is Bishop s creator . He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Queen embryo , which he claims will be destroyed . Knowing he is lying , Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform , which Morse positions over the furnace . The WeylandâYutani team shoot Morse in the leg in a late effort to stop him ; Aaron strikes the man with a wrench and is shot dead . The commando team begs Ripley to let them have the magnificent specimen with no success . Ripley throws herself into the furnace , just as the baby Alien Queen begins to erupt from her chest . Ripley grabs it to prevent it from escaping as they both fall into the furnace to their deaths . The facility is closed and the only surviving inmate , Morse , is led away .
