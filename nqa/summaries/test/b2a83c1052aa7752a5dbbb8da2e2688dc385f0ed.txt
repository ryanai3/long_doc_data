He eventually rises to become a candidate for governor , narrowly losing his first race , then winning on his second attempt . Along the way he loses his innocence and becomes as corrupt as the politicians he once fought against . When his son becomes paralyzed following a drunk driving accident that kills a female passenger , Stark s world starts to unravel and he discovers that not everyone can be bought off . The story has a complex series of relationships . All is seen through the eyes of the journalist , Jack Burden , who admires Stark and even when disillusioned still sticks by him .

The doctor eventually assassinates Stark after Stark wins an impeachment investigation . The doctor in turn is shot down by Sugar Boy , Stark s fawning assistant . The main plot is a thinly disguised version of the rise of real-life 1930s Louisiana Governor , Huey Long , Long s efforts to blacken the name of Judge Benjamin Pavy , and Long s assassination by the Judge s son-in-law ( compared to nephew , as in the film ) , Dr. Carl Weiss .
