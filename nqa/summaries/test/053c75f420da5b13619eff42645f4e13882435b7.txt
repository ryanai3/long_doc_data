On Saturday , March 24 , 1984 , five students report at 7:00Â a.m. for all-day detention at Shermer High School in Shermer , Illinois . While not complete strangers , each of them comes from a different clique , and they seem to have nothing in common : the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish , the state champion wrestler Andrew Clarke , the bookish Brian Johnson , the reclusive outcast Allison Reynolds , and the rebellious delinquent John Bender . They gather in the high school library , where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to speak , move from their seats , or sleep until they are released at 4:00Â p.m . He assigns them a 1,000-word essay , in which each must describe who you think you are . He then leaves , returning only occasionally to check on them . John , who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon , ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students , teasing Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire . Allison is initially quiet , except for an occasional random outburst . Over the course of the day , Vernon gives John several weekends ' worth of additional detention and even locks him in a storage closet , but he escapes and returns to the library . The students pass the hours by talking , arguing , and , at one point , smoking cannabis that John retrieves from his locker . Gradually , they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets : Allison is a compulsive liar ; Andrew can not easily think for himself ; John comes from an abusive household ; Brian was planning to kill himself with a flare gun due to a bad grade ; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends . They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents : Allison s parents ignore her due to their own problems ; Andrew s father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible ; John s father verbally and physically abuses him ; Brian s overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades ; and Claire s parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments . The students realize that , even with their differences , they face similar pressures and complications in their lives . Despite their differences in social status , the group begins to form friendships ( and even romantic relationships ) as the day progresses . Claire gives Allison a makeover , to reveal just how pretty she really is , which sparks romantic interest in Andrew . Claire decides to break her pristine virgin appearance by kissing John in the closet and giving him a hickey . Although they suspect that the relationships will end with the end of their detention , their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers afterwards . As the detention nears its end , the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone and John returns to the storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he has not left . Brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave . As the students part ways outside the school , Allison and Andrew kiss , as do Claire and John . Allison rips Andrew s state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep , and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings , which he attaches to his earlobe . Vernon reads the essay ( read by Brian in voice-over ) , in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are , using simple definitions and stereotypes . One by one , the five students ' voices add , But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain , and an athlete , and a basket case , a princess , and a criminal . Brian signs the letter as The Breakfast Club . John raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the school football field toward home .
