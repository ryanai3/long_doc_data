Two friends , Thelma Dickinson ( Geena Davis ) and Louise Sawyer ( Susan Sarandon ) , set out for a two-day vacation to take a break from their dreary lives . Thelma is married to a controlling man , Darryl ( Christopher McDonald ) , while Louise works as a waitress in a diner , and is dating a musician who spends most of his time on the road . They head out in Louise s 1966 Ford Thunderbird convertible . They stop for a drink at a roadhouse where Thelma meets and dances with Harlan Puckett ( Timothy Carhart ) . Thelma starts to feel sick , so Harlan takes her outside into the parking lot to get some fresh air . He starts kissing her and taking her clothes off . Thelma resists , but Harlan slaps her and begins to rape her . Louise finds them and threatens to shoot Harlan with a gun that Thelma brought with her . Harlan stops , but as the women walk away , he yells profanities and insults them . Louise responds by killing him . Thelma wants to go to the police , but Louise says that because Thelma was drunk and had been dancing with Harlan , no one would believe her claim of attempted rape . Afraid that she will be prosecuted , Louise decides to go on the run and Thelma accompanies her . Louise is determined to travel from Oklahoma to Mexico , but refuses to go through Texas . Something happened to her in Texas years earlier , but she refuses to say exactly what . Heading west , they come across an attractive young man named J.D . ( Brad Pitt ) , and Thelma convinces Louise to let him hitch a ride with them . Louise contacts her boyfriend Jimmy Lennox ( Michael Madsen ) and asks him to wire transfer her life savings to her . When she goes to pick up the money , she finds that Jimmy has come to see her to deliver the money in person . Thelma invites J.D . into her room and learns he is a thief who has broken parole . They sleep together , and J.D . describes how he conducted his hold-ups . At the same time , Jimmy asks Louise to marry him , but she declines . In the morning , Thelma tells Louise about her night with J.D . When they return to the motel room , they discover J.D . has stolen Louise s life savings and fled . Louise is distraught and frozen with indecision , so the guilty Thelma takes charge and robs a convenience store using the tactics she learned from listening to J.D . Meanwhile , the FBI are getting closer to catching the fugitives , after questioning J.D . and Jimmy , and tapping the phone line at Darryl s house . Arkansas State Police Investigator Hal Slocumb ( Harvey Keitel ) discovers that Louise had been raped years earlier in Texas . During a couple of brief phone conversations with her , he expresses sympathy for her predicament and pledges to protect her , but he is unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade her to surrender . When they are pulled over by a New Mexico state trooper ( Jason Beghe ) , Thelma holds him at gunpoint and locks him in the trunk of his car , while Louise takes his gun and ammunition . They then encounter a truck driver ( Marco St. John ) who repeatedly makes obscene gestures at them . They pull over and demand his apology , but when he refuses , they fire at the fuel tanker he is driving , causing it to explode . Leaving the man furious ( and stealing his hat ) , they drive off . Thelma and Louise are finally cornered by the authorities only one hundred yards ( 91Ã‚ m ) from the edge of the Grand Canyon . Hal arrives on the scene , but he is refused the chance to make one last attempt to talk the women into surrendering themselves . Rather than be captured and spend the rest of their lives in jail , Thelma proposes that they keep going ( over the cliff ) . Louise asks Thelma if she is certain , and Thelma says yes . They kiss , Louise steps on the accelerator , and they ride the car over the cliff to their presumed deaths .
