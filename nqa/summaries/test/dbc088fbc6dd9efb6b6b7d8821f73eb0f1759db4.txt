Wyatt Earp ( Kurt Russell ) , a retired peace officer with a notable reputation , reunites with his brothers Virgil ( Sam Elliott ) and Morgan ( Bill Paxton ) in Tucson , Arizona , where they venture on towards Tombstone , a small mining town , to settle down . There they encounter Wyatt s long-time friend Doc Holliday ( Val Kilmer ) , a Southern gambler and expert gunslinger , who seeks relief from his worsening tuberculosis . Josephine Marcus ( Dana Delany ) and Mr. Fabian ( Billy Zane ) are also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theater troupe . Meanwhile , Wyatt s common-law wife , Mattie Blaylock ( Dana Wheeler-Nicholson ) , is becoming dependent on a potent narcotic . Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys , led by Curly Bill Brocious ( Powers Boothe ) . The Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waist . Wyatt , though no longer a lawman , is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys as tensions rise . Curly Bill begins shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house and is approached by Marshal Fred White ( Harry Carey , Jr. ) to relinquish his firearms . Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt . The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton ( Stephen Lang ) and the other Cowboys . Curly Bill stands trial , but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses . Virgil , unable to tolerate lawlessness , becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits . This leads to the legendary Gunfight at the O.K . Corral , in which Billy Clanton ( Thomas Haden Church ) and other Cowboys are killed . Virgil and Morgan are wounded , and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan ( Jon Tenney ) with the Cowboys is made clear . As retribution for the Cowboy deaths , Wyatt s brothers are ambushed ; Morgan is killed , while Virgil is left handicapped . A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train , with Clanton and Frank Stilwell close behind , preparing to ambush them . Wyatt sees that his family leaves safely , and then surprises the assassins ; he kills Stilwell , but lets Clanton return to send a message . Wyatt announces that he is a U.S. marshal , and that he intends to kill any man that he sees wearing a red sash . Wyatt , Doc , a reformed Cowboy named Sherman McMasters ( Michael Rooker ) , along with their allies Texas Jack Vermillion ( Peter Sherayko ) and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson ( Buck Taylor ) , join forces to administer justice . Wyatt and his posse are ambushed in a riverside forest by the Cowboys . Hopelessly surrounded , Wyatt seeks out Curly Bill and kills him . Curly Bill s second-in-command , Johnny Ringo ( Michael Biehn ) , becomes the new head of the Cowboys . When Doc s health worsens , the group are accommodated by Henry Hooker ( Charlton Heston ) at his ranch . Ringo sends a messenger ( dragging McMasters ' corpse ) to Hooker s property telling Wyatt that he wants a showdown to end the hostilities ; Wyatt agrees . Wyatt sets off for the showdown , not knowing that Doc had already arrived at the scene . Doc confronts a surprised Ringo and kills him in a duel . Wyatt runs when he hears the gunshot only to encounter Doc . They then press on to complete their task of eliminating the Cowboys . Ike escapes when he gives up his sash , symbolically ending the Cowboys . Doc is sent to a sanatorium in Colorado where he later dies of his illness . At Doc s urging , Wyatt pursues Josephine to begin a new life . The film ends with a narration of an account of their long marriage , ending with Wyatt s death in Los Angeles in 1929 .
