U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , last aware of being on a mission in Afghanistan , wakes up on a commuter train to Chicago , at 7:40 am . To the world around him â including his traveling partner Christina Warren ( Michelle Monaghan ) and the bathroom mirror â he appears to be Sean Fentress , a school teacher . As he comes to grips with this revelation , the train explodes , killing everyone aboard . Stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit , leaking oil . Communicating through a video screen , Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin ( Vera Farmiga ) verifies Stevens ' identity , and insists he stay on mission to find the bomber before a large dirty bomb hits downtown Chicago in six hours . Inside the Source Code experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge ( Jeffrey Wright ) , he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person s life within an alternative timeline . Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating , exhausting attempts to learn the bomber s identity . He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina , escaping the explosion . Other times he can not locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train . But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real . It is revealed that he has been with them for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan . He is comatose and missing most of his body , hooked up to neural sensors . The cockpit capsule is in his imagination , his brain s way of making sense of a missing environment . A confused and frustrated Stevens asks , As one soldier to another , am I dead ? Angry to learn that he is on life support , he asks to be disconnected after the mission . Rutledge agrees . Stevens catches the bomber Derek Frost ( Michael Arden ) , who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death , and gets off at the last stop before Chicago . In one run-through , Frost kills both Fentress and Christina , and flees in a rented white van . Stevens remembers the license number and direction and the authorities use this information to catch the terrorist , preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb . The mission finished , Rutledge reneges on his promise , ordering Goodwin to wipe Stevens ' memory for a future mission . Stevens convinces Goodwin to allow one more try , to save everyone on the train , despite Rutledge s insistence that everyone on the train had already been killed in the explosion . Stevens is sent back into the Source Code where he disarms the bomb , subdues Frost and handcuffs him to a handrail inside the train . He reports the bomber to authorities , sends an email to Captain Goodwin , then calls to reconcile with his estranged father under the guise of a fellow soldier . He asks Christina what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live , and starts to kiss her . At the same time , Goodwin approaches the air-tight chamber that contains the torso of Stevens ' comatose mutilated body , disconnects the life support , and Stevens dies . Rutledge bangs on the outer door in vain . The scene cuts to Stevens finishing the kiss with Christina inside the Source Code , revealing that the alternate timeline of the Source Code has become real , contrary to what was proposed by Rutledge . They continue on the train , and then walk through downtown Chicago to the Cloud Gate , a sculpture whose image Stevens saw during transitions out of the Source Code . This prompts Stevens to ask Christina Do you believe in fate ? As they stand in front of the mirrored sculpture , Stevens ' reflection in the Cloud Gate is seen to be the image of Sean Fentress . When the alternative-timeline Goodwin arrives for work at Nellis Air Force Base that morning , she receives the email from Stevens . While news breaks about the failed bomber on the Chicago train , the email informs Goodwin that they have changed history , and Goodwin seemingly recalls something . The email asks her to reassure this timeline s Stevens that everything is gon na be okay . The scene cuts to Stevens who , in this timeline , is still comatose , hooked up to the neural sensors in the airtight chamber .
