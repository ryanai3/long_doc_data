Amateur tennis star Guy Haines ( Farley Granger ) wants to marry Anne Morton ( Ruth Roman ) , the daughter of a senator , and pursue a political career . First , he must divorce his vulgar and promiscuous wife Miriam ( Laura Elliott ) . On a train , Bruno Anthony ( Robert Walker ) recognizes Guy and knows about his marital situation from the gossip pages . Bruno introduces himself , then proposes an idea for the perfect homicide : he and Guy should swap murders . Bruno will murder Miriam , and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno s despised father . Each would be killing a stranger . Having no identifiable motive for the crimes , neither would be suspects . Guy humors Bruno s absurd murder plot by pretending to find it amusing . Bruno interprets this as agreement to the scheme . Bruno then borrows Guy s monogrammed cigarette lighter and slips it into his own pocket . Guy meets with Miriam . Pregnant by someone else , she now refuses to give Guy a divorce and threatens to cause a scandal . Guy relays the bad news to Anne , metaphorically commenting that he would like to strangle Miriam . Meanwhile , Bruno stalks Miriam through an amusement park and fatally strangles her on the Magic Isle . Bruno then informs Guy that Miriam is dead , and expects him to follow through on murdering Bruno s father . Bruno sends Guy his house key , a map to his father s bedroom , and a pistol . When the police question Guy about Miriam s death , he claims he was on a train at the time of the murder . The police determine his alibi is inconclusive because he could have left the train in time to commit the murder and continued his trip on another train . Guy is not arrested , but the police assign an officer to trail him to ensure he does not flee while they investigate . To pressure Guy into fulfilling his obligation , Bruno introduces himself to Anne and meets Anne s younger sister , Barbara ( Patricia Hitchcock ) , who physically resembles Miriam . Soon after , Bruno appears uninvited at a party at Senator Morton s house . To amuse another guest , Bruno demonstrates how to fatally strangle someone . His gaze happens to fall upon Barbara , and her resemblance to Miriam triggers a flashback . He begins strangling the woman but he blacks out before harming her . An upset Barbara tells Anne that , His hands were on her throat , but he was strangling me . Anne confronts Guy , who confesses the truth about Bruno s crazy scheme . Pretending to agree to Bruno s original plan , Guy sneaks into Mr. Anthony s bedroom intending to warn him of his son s murderous intent . It is Bruno who is waiting there , however . Guy tries to convince Bruno to seek psychiatric help . When Guy refuses to follow through with Bruno s plan , Bruno threatens to frame Guy for Miriam s murder . Anne visits Bruno s mother ( Marion Lorne ) to tell her that her son committed a murder , but the befuddled woman discounts it . Bruno appears and informs Anne that he intends to incriminate Guy by planting the stolen cigarette lighter at the amusement park . Anne and Guy devise a plan for Guy to finish his tennis match , evade the police , and reach the amusement park to prevent Bruno from planting the lighter . Guy eventually wins the long match at Forest Hills , then , eluding the police , heads for the amusement park . Bruno is also delayed when he accidentally drops Guy s lighter down a storm drain and has to recover it . Guy arrives at the amusement park . Bruno stays out of sight until sunset when he can plant the lighter on the Magic Isle . A worker recognizes Bruno from the night of the murder and informs the police . Guy catches up to Bruno , and they fight on the park s carousel . Thinking Guy is trying to escape , a police officer shoots at him , but his shot misses and kills the carousel operator instead . The dead man falls onto the control panel , and the carousel spins wildly out of control and crashes . The worker who recognized Bruno tells the police that Guy is innocent , and the mortally injured Bruno is the man he saw that night . Guy tells the police that Bruno was attempting to plant Guy s lighter at the murder scene . Bruno refuses to clear Guy , but as he dies , his fingers open to reveal Guy s lighter .
