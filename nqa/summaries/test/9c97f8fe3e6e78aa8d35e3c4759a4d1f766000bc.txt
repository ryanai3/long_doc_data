On Christmas Eve , a year after the Nakatomi Tower Incident , John McClane is waiting at Washington Dulles International Airport for his wife Holly to arrive from Los Angeles . Reporter Richard Thornburg , who exposed Holly s identity to Hans Gruber in the Nakatomi Tower , is assigned a seat across the aisle from her . In the airport bar McClane spots two men in army fatigues carrying a package , one of whom has a gun . He follows them into the baggage area . After a shootout , he kills one of the men while the other escapes . Learning the dead man is a mercenary thought killed in action while originally serving with the US military , McClane relates the situation to airport police Captain Carmine Lorenzo , but Lorenzo has McClane ejected from his office . Former U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Stuart and other members of his unit set up a base in a church near Dulles . They take over the air traffic control systems , cut off communication to the planes and seize control of the airport . Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza , a drug lord and dictator of Val Verde , who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges . They demand a Boeing 747 cargo plane so they can escape to another country , and warn the airport controllers not to try to restore control . McClane realizes his wife is on one of the planes circling above Washington , D.C. with too little fuel to be redirected . He prepares to fight the terrorists , allying himself with a janitor , Marvin , to gain larger access to the airport . Dulles communications director Leslie Barnes heads to the unfinished Annex Skywalk with a SWAT team to re-establish communications with the planes . Stuart s henchmen ambush the group at a checkpoint , killing the SWAT team . With Marvin s help , McClane reaches the massacre scene , rescuing Barnes and killing Stuart s men . Stuart responds by recalibrating the instrument landing system and then impersonating air traffic controllers to crash a British jet , killing all 230 passengers and crew on board . A U.S. Army Special Forces team is called in , led by Major Grant . A two-way radio dropped by one of Stuart s henchmen tips McClane that Esperanza , who s killed his captors and is now flying , is landing . With Marvin s aid , McClane reaches the aircraft before Stuart s henchmen , but Stuart traps him and throws grenades into the cockpit . McClane escapes via the ejection seat as the aircraft explodes . Barnes helps McClane locate the mercenaries s hideout and they tell Grant and his team to raid the location , but the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles . McClane pursues them , but the gun he picked up does not kill anyone when fired . He discovers that the gun is loaded with blanks , and concludes that the mercenaries and Special Forces have been working together all along . McClane contacts Lorenzo to intercept the Boeing 747 in which the mercenaries will escape , proving his story by firing at Lorenzo with the blank gun . A suspicious Thornburg is monitoring airport radio traffic , and learns about the situation from a secret transmission to the circling planes from Barnes . He phones in a sensational and exaggerated take on what is happening , leading to panic and preventing the officers from reaching the escape plane . Holly subdues Thornburg with a taser . McClane hitches a ride on a news helicopter that drops him off on the wing of the mercenary plane . He blocks the ailerons with his jacket , preventing the plane from taking off . Grant emerges and fights McClane , but is sucked into the jet engine and killed . Stuart then comes out and succeeds in knocking McClane off the plane , but as he falls McClane opens the fuel hatch . McClane uses his cigarette lighter to ignite the trail of fuel , which destroys the jet , killing Esperanza , Stuart and all on board . The passenger planes in the sky then use the lighted trail to land , and McClane and his wife are reunited .
