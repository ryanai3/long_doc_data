Hazel Grace Lancaster ( Shailene Woodley ) is an intelligent and witty teenager living in Indianapolis , who has terminal thyroid cancer that has since spread to her lungs . Believing she is depressed , Hazel s mother Frannie ( Laura Dern ) urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends who are going through the same thing . One week , Hazel meets Augustus Waters ( Ansel Elgort ) , a charming teenager who lost a leg from bone cancer years earlier but has since been cancer-free . He invites Hazel to his house and she accepts , where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other s favorite book . Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction , a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel s experience , and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence . They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer . After Augustus finishes the book , he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending ( it ends in the middle of a sentence ) . Hazel explains that the novel s mysterious author , Peter Van Houten ( Willem Dafoe ) , retreated to Amsterdam following the novel s publication and has not been heard from since . Weeks later , Augustus tells Hazel that he has traced Van Houten s assistant , Lidewij ( Lotte Verbeek ) , and has corresponded with Van Houten by email . Hazel then writes to him to find out more about the novel s ambiguous ending and Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person . Overwhelmed and excited , Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him , but Frannie rejects it because of financial and medical constraints . Augustus suggests that she use her cancer wish since children and young adults with life-threatening illnesses receive one arranged experience of their choice , but Hazel explains that she already used hers to visit Disney World when she was younger . Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and soon begin to fall in love . Augustus also surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam after using his wish on her . However , days before the trip , Hazel suffers from pleural effusion and is sent to an intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Although initially concerned , her doctors eventually agree to allow the trip , since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all . Hazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam and are presented with reservations at an expensive restaurant , pre-paid for by Van Houten . During the meal , Augustus confesses his love for Hazel . The following afternoon , they get the bus into the city and head to Van Houten s house , but are soon shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic ; Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner on his behalf without him knowing anything about it . Angered by his assistant s actions , he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition . She leaves , utterly distraught . On their way back to the hotel , Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience . The three visit the Anne Frank House , where Hazel struggles to climb the house s many stairs . At the end of the tour , Augustus and Hazel kiss to the applause of many fellow tourists . They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time . The next day while out in the city , Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has relapsed , has spread throughout his body and is terminal . Hazel is heartbroken , expressing how unfair life can be . After their return to Indianapolis , Augustus ' health worsens each week . Hazel receives a desperate call from him late at night after he tries to get a new pack of cigarettes at the gas station . He is taken to the ICU for a few days and realizes he is close to death . Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac ( Nat Wolff ) and Hazel to his pre-funeral , where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared . Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything , since he gave me a forever within the numbered days . Augustus dies eight days later . At his funeral , Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance . He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip . He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna , who died from leukemia at a young age . Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna s mother ; he gives Hazel a piece of paper . Hazel , still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam , crumples up the paper and asks him to leave . Later , talking with Isaac , Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her . She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus ' words , which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel . Hazel lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars , smiling as she remembers Augustus and says Okay .
