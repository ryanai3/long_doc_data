A deadly virus wipes out almost all of humanity in 1996 , forcing remaining survivors to live underground . A mysterious group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be behind the virus . In 2035 , James Cole ( Willis ) is a prisoner living in a subterranean shelter beneath the ruins of Philadelphia . Cole is selected for a mission , where he is trained and sent back in time to collect information on the virus in order to help scientists develop a cure . Meanwhile , Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and an airport shooting . Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990 , not 1996 as planned . He is arrested , then hospitalized in a mental institution on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly ( Stowe ) . There he encounters Jeffrey Goines ( Pitt ) , a fellow mental patient with fanatical views . After an escape attempt , Cole is locked in a cell , but soon disappears , returning to the future . Back in his own time , Cole is interviewed by the scientists , who play a distorted voicemail message which discloses the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and asserts their association with the virus . He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved , including Goines . He is given a second chance to go back in time , but another error results in him arriving at a battlefield of World War I . He is wounded in the leg and then suddenly sent to 1996 . In 1996 , Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists . At the post-lecture book signing , Dr. Peters ( Morse ) questions her about mankind s sustainability on earth and points out that humanity s gradual destruction of the environment may be the real lunacy . Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it , and when Railly departs , he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia . They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys , and set out in search of him . When they confront him , however , Goines denies any involvement with the virus and says that wiping out humanity was Cole s idea at the asylum in 1990 . Cole convinces himself that he is insane , but Railly confronts him with evidence of his time travel . They decide to spend their remaining time together in the Florida Keys before the onset of the plague . On their way to the airport , they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic ; the group s major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines ' Nobel Prize winning virologist father ( Plummer ) in an animal cage . At the airport , Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are on the wrong track , and that he will not return . He is soon confronted by Jose ( Seda ) , an acquaintance from his own time , who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders . At the same time , Railly spots Dr. Peters , and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines ' father s virology lab . Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks . Cole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters . After drawing the gun he was given , Cole is fatally shot by police . As Cole lies dying in Railly s arms , she makes eye contact with a small boyâthe young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death , which will replay in his dreams for years to come . Peters , aboard the plane with the virus , sits down next to Jones ( Florence ) , one of the scientists from the future .
