Jill Johnson ( Carol Kane ) is babysitting the children of Dr. Mandrakis ( Carmen Argenziano ) at their home . When the children are asleep , Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children . At first , Jill dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke . However , as the calls become more frequent and threatening , Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police , who promise to trace the caller if Jill keeps him on the telephone line long enough . Jill , frightened to extreme measures , arms herself as she receives one final call from the nefarious stalker . Soon after the conversation , Jill receives a call from the police , only to find out that the stalker is calling from inside the house . A light comes on at the top of the staircase , and Jill sees the stalker s shadow . In a panic , she immediately runs to the door , unhooks the chain lock only to reveal a close-up of a detective when she screams . The camera then zooms out . Afterwards , Officer John Clifford ( Charles Durning ) investigates the matter . It turns out that the children were murdered by the perp several hours earlier . The killer is identified as an English merchant seaman named Curt Duncan ( Tony Beckley ) , and is subsequently sent to an asylum . Seven years later , Duncan escapes from the asylum , still psychopathic . Dr. Mandrakis hires Clifford , now a private investigator to find Duncan . Not knowing Clifford is after him , Duncan is now a homeless , vagrant loner . He gets into a fight and is beaten after disturbing a middle-aged woman , Tracy ( Colleen Dewhurst ) , in a tavern , and later follows her to her apartment . Feeling sorry for his disastrous appearance and for the fact that his attempts at conversation with her started the fight in the first place , Tracy makes light conversation with him . While they are in the doorway talking , Tracy s phone rings . As she goes to answer it , Duncan lets himself and appears behind her when she gets off the phone . She explicitly rebuffs his awkward proposal to visit her for coffee the next night , assuming or hoping it will be the last of him she will see . Meanwhile an increasingly obsessed and vindictive Clifford , having confided to a former partner ( Ron O'Neal ) that his intention is to kill Duncan rather than arrest him , follows the trail to the tavern where the fight took place , then to Tracy s residenceâthe same night Duncan is likely to arrive for his visit . Clifford goes there and tells Tracy just how dangerous her situation has become , revealing that Duncan literally tore and hacked up Mandrakis ' children with his bare hands , rendering them virtually unrecognizable . Tracy reluctantly accepts to be Clifford s bait at the tavern that evening , but Duncan does not arrive and she decides to return home . Clifford then leaves Tracy s place , but she is then attacked by Duncan , who was hiding in her closet . Tracy screams for help , and Clifford returns and chases Duncan away from the scene . In the streets of downtown Los Angeles , he loses Duncan s trail . Jill Johnson is now an adult , married with two young children . One night , she and her husband Stephen go out to dinner in celebration of a promotion , and a friend named Sharon babysits her children . At the restaurant , Jill gets a telephone call from someone asking , Have you checked the children ? Jill panics and calls Sharon . It appears that nothing is wrong at first , but then the call is suddenly disconnected . The police arrive and escort Jill back home and find that everything is fine . Clifford tries to call Jill , but finds that the line is disconnected . Jill and Stephen sleep . Later , Jill goes down for a glass of milk , when the lights suddenly go out . She goes back upstairs and returns to bed . She picks up the phone and discovers that the phone line is dead . The closet door opens a little , and she hears the voice of Curt Duncan . She tries to awaken Stephen , who turns around , revealing that it is actually Curt in the bed . He rips Jill s nightgown and chases her around the room . Clifford arrives and shoots Curt , killing him . Stephen is revealed to be in the closet , alive but seemingly unconscious . As Clifford comforts Jill , the last view is of the house , in view of the frightening eyes of Curt Duncan .
