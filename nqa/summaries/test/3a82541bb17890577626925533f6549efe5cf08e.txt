Bobby has distanced himself from his father , NYPD Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky ( Robert Duvall ) , and his brother , Captain Joseph Grusinsky ( Mark Wahlberg ) . He uses the maiden name of his mother , Carol Green , as his last name , preferring to remain on the sidelines and enjoy a hedonistic life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez ( Eva Mendes ) and best friend Louis Jumbo Falsetti ( Danny Hoch ) . When Joseph leads a police raid on El Caribe in the hopes of arresting Vadim , Bobby refuses to cooperate . The incident strains Bobby s relationship with his father and brother even more , to the point that Bobby and Joseph come to blows . The police are unsuccessful in making a case against Vadim , who decides to retaliate . The next evening , Joseph is shot by a masked assailant , and his unmarked police cruiser firebombed . Joseph survives the ambush , but is hospitalized for four months . Vadim , unaware of Bobby s family ties , confides that the Chief will be the next victim . Bobby resolves to help the police . Without his father s knowledge , Bobby goes undercover inside Vadim s cocaine-smuggling operation with a police listening device hidden in a cigarette lighter , but when the device is discovered , he narrowly escapes being murdered , and the police raid the operation and arrest Vadim . Bobby and Amada are placed in protective police custody , and their relationship begins to deteriorate . Months later , Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital . The police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location . During a blinding thunderstorm , the police convoy is intercepted by Vadim s men , and during a chaotic car chase , Burt is fatally shot . Bobby passes out in the rain when he sees his father s body . The police take Bobby and Amada back to a hotel near Kennedy Airport . Bobby wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the hotel room . After Joseph tells him that their father died , the grief-stricken Bobby asks how they found them . At the subsequent funeral , a colleague of Joseph s , Captain Jack Shapiro , gives him Burt s Korean War medal . Bobby is told that a Russian shipment of cocaine is arriving sometime in the coming week . To avenge his father , Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada , who leaves him . After he is sworn into the NYPD , Bobby learns the true involvement of Jumbo , his friend , and Marat , Vadim s uncle . He and Joseph organize a final sting operation , set for April 4 , 1989 .

Nearly a year after the raid on El Caribe , Bobby , now in uniform , graduates from the NYPD Police Academy to become a full-time police officer . Before the ceremony , Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector , since the shooting led him to realize that he needs to spend more time with his children . As the chaplain announces that Bobby is to give the valedictorian address , Bobby thinks he sees Amada in the audience , but it turns out to be an illusion . Bobby and Joseph express their brotherly love .
