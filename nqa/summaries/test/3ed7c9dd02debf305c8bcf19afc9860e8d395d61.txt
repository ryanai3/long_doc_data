In Cleveland , 1972 , Russell Stevens Jr. is the son of a drug addicted , alcoholic man . His father tells his son never to be like him . Stevens then witnesses his father getting killed while robbing a liquor store . He swears that he will never end up the way he has . Twenty years later , in Cincinnati , 1991 , Stevens is now a police officer . Officer Stevens is recruited by DEA Special Agent Gerald Carver to go undercover on a major sting operation in Los Angeles , claiming that his criminal-like character traits will be more of a benefit undercover than they would serve him as a uniformed policeman . Stevens poses as drug dealer John Hull in order to infiltrate and work his way up the network of the west coast s largest drug importer , Anton Gallegos and his uncle Hector Gúzman , a South American politician . Stevens relocates to a cheap hotel in LA and begins dealing cocaine . One day Stevens is arrested by the devoutly religious L.A.P.D . Narcotics Detective Taft and his corrupt partner Hernández , when he buys a kilogram in a set-up by Gallegos ' low-level street supplier Eddie Dudley . At his arraignment , Stevens discovers that he was sold baby laxative ( mannitol ) instead of cocaine and his case is dismissed . Stevens ' self-appointed attorney David Jason , who is also a drug trafficker in Gallegos ' network , rewards Stevens ' silence with more cocaine and introduces Stevens to Felix Barbossa , the underboss to Gallegos . Felix realized that Eddie was working with the LAPD , which results in Felix killing him and enlisting Stevens as Eddie s replacement . Stevens develops a romance with Betty McCutcheon , the manager of an art dealership which serves as a front to launder Jason s drug money profits . When one of Stevens ' dealers is murdered by a rival dealer named Ivy , Stevens kills him and is awarded a partnership in Jason s new business venture ; distribution of a synthetic chemical variant of cocaine . It turns out that Felix is working with Detective Hernández who pressures him into giving him more arrests . Felix immediately gives up Stevens , Jason , and Betty , since he views them as expendable and wants to kill Jason because of his business venture . Carver knows about the upcoming bust , but refuses to interfere forcing Stevens to violate orders and stop it himself . At the deal , Stevens exposes Felix as a police informant , which results in a vengeful Jason killing him . Gallegos comes to personally meet with Jason and Stevens and informs them that they have inherited Felix s $ 1.8 million debt . Later that same day , Stevens meets with Carver to tell him about his meeting with Gallegos . Instead Carver pulls a gun on Stevens and orders him to surrender his weapon and get in his car . Angrily Stevens disarms Carver and forces him to reveal what s happening behind the scenes . Carver admits that the State Department is leaving Gallegos and Guzman alone because Guzman may someday be useful as a political asset to them . Stevens ' disillusionment reaches its conclusion and he abandons his undercover status vowing to take down Gallegos and Guzman alone . Stevens and Jason learn that Gallegos is going to kill them anyway , so instead of paying Gallegos , Jason and Stevens cleverly kill him and steal a van storing over a $ 100 million of Gallegos ' cash . Jason and Stevens invite Guzman to a shipyard and offer to return 80 % of Gallegos ' money if he agrees to invest the remaining 20 % in their synthetic cocaine distribution operation . Detective Taft , who has been tailing Stevens , interrupts the deal but is unable to arrest Guzman because of his diplomatic status . Guzman flees the scene before Taft s backup arrives . Taft orders Stevens to surrender , but is shot and wounded by Jason . Stevens reveals to Jason that he is a police officer but Jason ignores this information and cajoles him into joining Jason and abandoning the dying Taft . Jason kills Taft , despite Stevens ' pleas to let him go . Stevens then reaffirms himself as a police officer and attempts to arrest Jason , but is forced to kill him when Jason draws his gun . Afterwards , Carver leverages Stevens by threatening to charge Betty with several bank fraud violations . In exchange for his favorable testimony of Carver , the DEA , and their sting operation , Stevens can prevent Betty s prosecution . Stevens agrees , but during his testimony to the House Judiciary Subcommittee , he produces a video tape of the incriminating conversation with Guzman at the shipyard , thus potentially ruining Guzman s and Carver´s career . Later he contemplates what to do with the $ 11 million of Gallegos ' money that he secretly kept .
