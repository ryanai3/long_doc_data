On Christmas Eve , 1944 , somewhere in Europe , two World War II U.S. Army soldiers , one a Broadway entertainer , Captain Bob Wallace ( Bing Crosby ) , the other an aspiring entertainer , Private Phil Davis ( Danny Kaye ) , perform for the 151st Division . But word has come down that their beloved commanding officer , Major General Thomas F. Waverly ( Dean Jagger ) , is being relieved of command . He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell . The men give him a rousing send-off ( The Old Man ) . After the war , Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs , radio , and then on Broadway , eventually becoming successful producers . They mount their newest hit musical titled Playing Around . The same day they receive a letter from Freckle-Faced Haynes , the dog-faced boy , their mess sergeant from the war , asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing . When they go to the club to watch the act ( Sisters ) , Phil notices that Bob is smitten with Betty ( Rosemary Clooney ) , while Phil has eyes for her sister , Judy ( Vera-Ellen ) . Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table , and Phil dances with Judy so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other . Phil and Judy hit it off ( The Best Things Happen While You re Dancing ) . Judy and Betty head for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree , Vermont , where they are booked to perform over the holidays . Phil gives the sisters his and Bob s sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train to Vermont . When the train arrives in Pine Tree , there s not a snowflake in sight , and chances of it falling appear dim . Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer , General Waverly . Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge , which is in danger of failing because there s no snow and thus no guests . To bring business to the inn , Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical Playing Around , and add in Betty and Judy . Bob and Betty s relationship blooms ( Count Your Blessings ) and they spend a good deal of time together . Meanwhile , Bob discovers the General s request to rejoin the army has been rejected . He decides to prove to the General that he is n't forgotten . Bob calls Ed Harrison ( Johnny Grant ) , an old army buddy , now a successful variety show host , to arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise . In response , Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis . Unbeknownst to Bob , nosy housekeeper Emma Allen ( Mary Wickes ) was eavesdropping , but she only heard the part about free advertising , not Bob s rejection of the idea . Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be portrayed as a pitiable figure in a nationwide broadcast , Emma reveals what she heard to a shocked Betty . The misunderstanding causes Betty to grow suddenly cold toward a baffled Bob . Meanwhile , Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married . She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement , but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer . Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony , and Bob , still unaware of the real reason behind Betty s coldness , follows Betty to New York . Bob sees Betty s new act ( Love , You Did n't Do Right by Me ) and reveals the truth about the engagement , but is called away by Ed Harrison before learning what is really bothering her . Back at the Inn , Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he wo n't see the broadcast of Bob s announcement . On the broadcast , Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree , Vermont , on Christmas Eve ( What Can You Do with a General ) . Betty catches Bob s televised pitch and realizes she was mistaken . She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show . When the General enters the lodge , he is greeted by his former division , who sing a rousing chorus of The Old Man . Just as the following number ( Gee , I Wish I Was Back in the Army ) ends , he learns that snow is finally falling . In the finale , Bob and Betty declare their love for one another , as do Phil and Judy . The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling , everyone raises a glass , and toasts , May your days be merry and bright ; and may all your Christmases be white .
