In Rome , in the 1980s , famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening , where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died . Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo , Sicily in 30 years . As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is , Salvatore flashes back to his childhood . It is a few years after World War II . Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous , intelligent son of a war widow . Nicknamed Toto , he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso . Although they initially start off on tense terms , he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist , Alfredo , who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth . During the shows , the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections , causing the films to suddenly jump , bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace . The local priest had ordered these sections censored , and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor . At first , Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest , but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector . The montage ends as the movie house catches fire ( highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time ) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of Viggiù after hours , on the wall of a nearby house . Salvatore saves Alfredo s life , but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo s face , leaving him permanently blind . The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen , Ciccio , who invests his football lottery winnings . Salvatore , still a child , is hired as the new projectionist , as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines . About a decade later , Salvatore , now in high school , is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso . His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened , and Salvatore often looks to him for help — advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films . Salvatore has been experimenting with film , using a home movie camera , and he has met , and captured on film , Elena , daughter of a wealthy banker . Salvatore woos — and wins — Elena s heart , only to lose her due to her father s disapproval . As Elena and her family move away , Salvatore leaves town for compulsory military service . His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless ; his letters are returned as undeliverable . Upon his return from the military , Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently , counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams . Moreover , the old man tells him , once Salvatore leaves , he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly , never looking back and never returning , even to visit ; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them . They tearfully embrace , and Salvatore leaves town to pursue his future , as a filmmaker . Salvatore has obeyed Alfredo , but he returns home to attend the funeral . Though the town has changed greatly , he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave . Alfredo s widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore s successes with pride , and he left him something — an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector . Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot . At the funeral , he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist . Salvatore returns to Rome . He watches Alfredo s reel and discovers that it comprises a very special montage . It contains all of the romantic scenes the priest had ordered cut from movies ; Alfredo had spliced the sequences together to form a single film . Salvatore has made peace with his past .
