Lara Brennan ( Elizabeth Banks ) is convicted of murdering her boss and is sentenced to life in prison . The evidence seems impossible to dispute : many colleagues saw her having a quarrel with the victim , their cars are parked right next to each other , she is seen leaving the crime scene seconds before the body is discovered , the murder weapon ( a fire extinguisher ) has her fingerprints on it and she has the victim s blood on the back of her overcoat . Following the failure of her appeal , her son Luke ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits . One day , Lara attempts suicide , unwilling to spend the rest of her life in prison . Her husband John Brennan ( Russell Crowe ) , a professor at a community college , becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her out of jail . John consults Damon Pennington ( Liam Neeson ) , a former convict who escaped prison seven times . Damon gives John advice , along with a warning that the initial escape will be easy compared to evading the police after that . Following Damon s advice , John begins his preparation . He obtains a handgun and fake IDs , and studies the map of Pittsburgh for escape routes . To get money , he sells their house s furniture and personal belongings . John attempts to break Lara out from the prison in which she is held but abandons the plan when he is almost caught testing a self-made bump key on an elevator . When John is told that Lara will be transferred in 72 hours to another prison facility , he is forced to come up with an emergency plan . Unable to get the money from his house in time , he considers robbing a bank , but hesitates at the last minute . Instead , John tails a local drug dealer to a drug lord , then robs him . Following clues left behind at the drug lord s house , the police track down John s car , get to his empty house and conclude that he is planning to break his wife out . John tears down the big map filled with notes and photos of his escape plan , and scatter the pieces . He leaves Luke at his classmate s birthday party , then plants falsified blood work indicating that Lara is in a state of hyperglycaemia . Lara is transferred to a nearby hospital , where John convinces her to escape with him . John and Lara leave the hospital , narrowly escaping the police and leave the city center . They then find out that Luke is at the zoo for the birthday party . John drives there to retrieve him , by which point the police have already established roadblocks on all interstate routes . Anticipating that police are looking for a couple and a child , John improvises by picking up an elderly couple . They drive through the checkpoint without incident and proceed to Buffalo , New York , where John drops off the couple . The Brennans cross the border into Canada and head to an airport . Meanwhile , John s parents refuse to cooperate with the police . The police examine the escape plan fragments to figure out his destination , but are misled by the photos and delay the wrong flight . A detective returns to the crime scene where Lara s boss was killed . He remembers Lara saying a button popped off as the mugger bumped into her , and deduces that it must have fallen in the storm drain . He searches the storm drain but is unable to find the button . It turns out the button was there , buried under grime , and the detective just missed it . While the police have n't the evidence to exonerate Lara Brennan , the audience does , because a flashback reveals how her boss died at the hands of a mugger , and how Lara came to have the victim s blood on her coat , and her fingerprints on the murder weapon . At the end of the film , the family arrives at a hotel in Caracas , Venezuela . As Lara lies down next to him , Luke kisses his mother and falls asleep . John takes a picture of their sleeping faces as the movie ends .
