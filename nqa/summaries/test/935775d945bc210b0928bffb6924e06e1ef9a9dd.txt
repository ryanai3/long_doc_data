Bastian Balthazar Bux is a shy and friendless bibliophile 12-year-old , teased by bullies from school . On his way to school , he hides from the bullies in a bookstore , interrupting the grumpy bookseller , Mr. Coreander . Bastian asks about one of the books he sees , but Mr. Coreander advises against it . His curiosity piqued , Bastian seizes the book , leaving a note promising to return it , and hides in the school s attic to read . The book describes the world of Fantasia slowly being devoured by a force called The Nothing . Fantasia s ruler , the Childlike Empress , has fallen ill , and Atreyu is tasked to discover the cure , believing that once the Empress is well , the Nothing will no longer be a threat . Atreyu is given a medallion named the AURYN that can guide and protect him in the quest . As Atreyu sets out , the Nothing summons Gmork , a wolf-like creature , to kill Atreyu . Atreyu s quest directs him to the advisor Morla the Ancient One in the Swamps of Sadness . Though the AURYN protects Atreyu , his beloved horse Artax is lost to the swamp , and he continues alone . Later , Atreyu is surprised by the sudden appearance of Morla , a giant turtle . Bastian , reading , is also surprised and lets out a scream , which Atreyu and Morla appear to hear . Morla does not have the answers Atreyu seeks , but directs him to the Southern Oracle , ten thousand miles distant . Atreyu succumbs to exhaustion trying to escape the Swamps but is saved by the luckdragon Falkor ( voiced by Alan Oppenheimer ) . Falkor takes him to the home of two gnomes that live near the entrance to the Southern Oracle . The gnomes explain that Atreyu will face various trials before reaching the Oracle . Atreyu proceeds to enter the Oracle , and is perplexed when one second trial , a mirror that shows the viewer s true self , reveals a boy which Bastian recognizes as himself . Bastian throws the book aside , but after catching his breath , continues to read . Atreyu eventually meets the Southern Oracle who tells him the only way to save the Empress is to find a human child to give her a new name , beyond the boundaries of Fantasia . Atreyu and Falkor flee before the Nothing consumes the Southern Oracle . In flight , Atreyu is knocked from Falkor s back into the Sea of Possibilities , losing the AURYN in the process . He wakes on the shore of the abandoned ruins , and finds a series of paintings depicting his quest . Gmork reveals himself , having been lying in wait and explains that Fantasia represents humanity s imagination , and that the Nothing represents adult apathy and cynicism against it . Atreyu fends off and kills Gmork as the Nothing begins to consume the ruins . Falkor , who had managed to locate AURYN , rescues Atreyu in time . The two find themselves in a void with only small fragments of Fantasia remaining , and fear they have failed when they spot the Empress s Ivory Tower among the fragment . Inside , Atreyu apologizes for failing the Empress , but she assures him he has succeeded in bringing to her a human child who has been following his quest . As the Nothing begins to consume the Tower , the Empress pleas directly to Bastian to call out her new name . Bastian calls out the name he had selected , and loses consciousness . When he wakes , he finds himself in blackness with the Empress , with only a grain of sand the last bit of Fantasia remaining . The Empress tells Bastian that he has the power to bring Fantasia back with his imagination using the power of the AURYN . Bastian re-creates Fantasia , and as he flies on Falkor s back , he sees the land and its inhabitants restored , and that Atreyu has been reunited with Artax . When Falkor tells him he can wish for anything , Bastian then brings Falkor back to the real world to chase down the bullies from before . The film ends with the narration that Bastian had many more wishes and adventures , and adds : but that s another story .
