The film follows three friends who have been in a rut in their lives : Adam Yates ( John Cusack ) is dumped by his girlfriend ; Nick Webber-Agnew ( Craig Robinson ) is a henpecked husband with a dead-end job at a dog spa ; and Lou Dorchen ( Rob Corddry ) is a party animal in his 40s . When Lou is hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning , Adam and Nick sympathetically take him and Adam s shut-in 20-year-old nephew Jacob ( Clark Duke ) to a ski resort at Kodiak Valley , where the three had some good times in the past . During a night of heavy drinking in the hotel room s hot tub , they spill the contents of a drink called Chernobly on the console . The next day , they go skiing , but after too many strange occurrences ( people dressed in 1980s fashion , music videos on MTV , and that Michael Jackson is still black ) , they realize they have traveled back to 1986 . Not only that , but they have also assumed their younger bodies : they see each other as their normal age , but in their reflections and to other people , they appear as they did back then , except Jacob , who appears as himself but occasionally flickers . A mysterious hot tub repairman ( Chevy Chase ) appears and warns them not to change anything as it might affect the machine . In order to minimize the butterfly effect , the guys plan to re-enact their experiences . Adam has to break up with his girlfriend Jenny ( Lyndsy Fonseca ) and get stabbed in the eye with a fork ; Lou must pick a fight and get beaten up by Blaine ( Sebastian Stan ) , a ski patrol bully ; and Nick must have sex with a groupie , and give a bad performance with his band at an open mic event . Jacob discovers his mother Kelly ( Collette Wolfe ) is at the resort but is acting rather slutty ; he tries to figure out who is his father . The guys find the tasks rather difficult as Lou gets punched by Blaine and loses his backpack , but realizes he must face him again later at night , so he reluctantly challenges him again . Adam falls in love with Jenny again while meeting a music journalist named April ( Lizzy Caplan ) during the Poison concert . Nick worries about cheating on his wife even though the events occur before he even meets her . Later on , Lou tries to cash in on some sports betting using his knowledge of the game s outcomes ; it works until he risks everything on predicting a game-winning touchdown , only to have the squirrel that he vomited on earlier at the resort crash the field and ruin the play . Jenny turns the tables as she initiates the breakup with Adam , but Adam later meets April and they get along . Nick changes his destiny by covering the more upbeat Jessie s Girl , followed by a preview version of Let s Get It Started . When the repairman later informs Jacob that some nuclear chemical was the key to their time travel , Jacob realizes it was the Chernobly , an illegal Russian energy drink . The guys rescue Lou , who was beaten up without his friends again , from falling off the rooftop . They go to Blaine s cabin to search for the drink , during which Lou finds and seduces Kelly . The guys realize that Lou is actually Jacob s father . After Lou finally punches Blaine , they retrieve the Chernobly and return to the hot tub where they create a vortex . Jacob and Nick get in the tub but Lou decides to stay in 1986 , admitting he had indeed attempted suicide before . Adam volunteers to stay with Lou , but is thrown into the vortex . Back at the present , Adam , Nick , and Jacob discover that Lou has changed history by founding Lougle , and is enjoying a luxurious lifestyle with Kelly . Adam discovers that he is happily married to April , and Nick discovers he is a successful music producer married to a loyal and loving Courtney . The guys reunite at Lou s mansion with their families , satisfied with their new lives . During the film s closing credits , Lou is shown to be the frontman of Motley Lç«¯e and sings in a video Home Sweet Home .
