Seventeen-year-old Charley Brewster is a fan of both traditional horror films and a horror TV series entitled Fright Night , hosted by former movie vampire hunter Peter Vincent . One evening , Charley discovers that his new next door neighbour Jerry Dandrige , is a vampire responsible for the disappearences of several victims . Charley tries to tell his mother and asks his friends for help . In desperation , he contacts the police , but they believe that he is imagining things and ignore his claims after revealing his suspicions to them when he accompanies a homicide officer to Jerry s house . That night , Charley gets a visit from Jerry , who offers Charley a choice by forgetting about his vampire identity , but he refuses by using his crucifix on Jerry . When Jerry stops Charley and slowly tries to push him out the window to his death , he stabs Jerry s hand with a pencil . Enraged , Jerry destroys Charley s car in retaliation and threatens Charley that he plans to do much worse to him later . Charley turns to Peter Vincent for help , but Peter dismisses Charley as an obsessed fan . Charley s girlfriend , Amy Peterson , fears for Charley s sanity and safety , resulting her hiring the destitute Vincent to prove that Jerry is not a vampire by having him drink what they claim is holy water , but it turns out to only be tap water ; Jerry having claimed to Peter that drinking actual holy water would be against his religious convictions . Vincent discovers Jerry s true nature after glancing at his pocket mirror and noticing Jerry s lack of a reflection , causing him to accidentally drop and smash the mirror . Vincent then flees , but Jerry learns of his discovery after finding a piece of his pocket mirror on the floor . Jerry hunts down and turns Charley s friend , Evil Ed Thompson , into a vampire . Evil then visits Vincent and tries to attack him , only to be warded off when injured by a crucifix . Meanwhile , Jerry chases Charley and Amy into a club . While Charley is trying to call the police for help , Jerry hypnotizes and abducts Amy who bears a resemblance to Jerry s lost love ( whom Jerry has a painting of ) . With nowhere left to turn , Charley attempts to gain Vincent s help once more . A frightened Vincent ( following Evil s attack ) initially refuses , but he then reluctantly resumes his Vampire Killer role as Charley approaches his neighbour s house . The two are able to repel Jerry s attack using a crucifix , though only Charley s works since he has faith in its spiritual power . Jerry s protector , Billy Cole , appears and knocks Charley unconscious over the banister , having Vincent flees to Charley s house . At his house , he finds that Mrs. Brewster is still not home and is attacked by Evil , who transforms into a wolf . Vincent seemingly kills him after staking him through the heart but later removes the stake . Meanwhile , an unconscious Charley is taken to Amy who has been turned into a vampire by Jerry . Vincent says the process can be reversed , but only if they kill Jerry before dawn . Charley and Vincent are then confronted by Billy whom Vincent shoots since he saw his reflection in the mirror . However , Billy is revealed to be a zombie-like creature , who rises again and continues advancing towards them until he is killed by Charley who stakes him and then melts into goo and dust . Jerry appears , but Vincent is able to lure the overconfident vampire in front of a window using a crucifix ( now working due to his renewed faith in its abilities ) . Just before the morning sun , Jerry transforms into a bat and attacks Vincent and Charley ( biting Charley in the process ) before fleeing to his coffin in the basement . Charley and Vincent go in pursuit of Jerry ; Vincent breaks open Jerry s coffin and tries to stake him through the heart whilst Charley has to fight off Amy who has completed her transformation . By breaking the blacked-out windows in the basement , Vincent and Charley expose Jerry to the sunlight and kills him . Jerry s death leads Amy reverting to her human form and the three embrace . A few nights later , Vincent returns to his Fright Night TV series and announces a hiatus from vampires by instead presenting Octaman . The series is being watched by Charley and Amy as they embrace together in bed . When Charley goes to turn off the TV , he at first sees red eyes in Jerry s now-vacant house , but dismisses them . Unbeknownst to both Charley and Amy , a survived Evil with red eyes ( hiding in the darkness ) laughs and says Oh , you re so cool , Brewster !
