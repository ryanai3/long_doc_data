In 1996 , as part of a new military training program , a group of orphaned infants are selected at birth and raised as highly disciplined soldiers with no understanding of anything but military routine . They are trained to be ruthless obedient killers , and all those considered to be physically or mentally unworthy are executed . The survivors are turned into impassive dedicated fighting machines with no exposure to or understanding of the outside world . In 2035 , at the age of 39 , Sgt . Todd 3465 is a hardened veteran and the best soldier of the original 1996 infants , but his unit is challenged for replacement by a superior unit . Colonel Mekum , leader of the original project , introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers , designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion , except complete aggression . Captain Church , the commander of Todd s unit , insists on testing the new soldiers ' abilities against his proven older ones . A new soldier , Caine 607 , easily defeats three of the original soldiers , but Todd gouges out Caine s eye before he seemingly dies when he falls from a great height ; the body of a dead soldier actually cushioned his fall , and he is simply stunned and knocked unconscious . Mekum orders their bodies disposed of like garbage , declaring them obsolete , while the remaining older soldiers are demoted to menial unarmed support roles . Dumped on Arcadia 234 , a waste disposal planet , Todd limps toward a colony whose residents crash-landed there years earlier ; as they were believed dead , no rescue missions have been attempted . Todd is sheltered by Mace and his wife Sandra . Though they try to make him welcome , Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extremely rigid impassive conditioning and their conflict-free lives . Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son , Nathan , who had been traumatized by a snakebite as an infant , and watches upon the happy loving family with yearning in his eyes . When the child silently looks to him for a defense against a coiled snake , Todd refuses , demanding that Nathan face it down and strike back to protect himself . Nathan s parents intervene and disapprove of the lesson , unsure of how to deal with the silent soldier . Todd becomes disoriented by exposure to peaceful civilian life and soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time killing civilians and battling other soldiers . To make matters worse , he mistakes one of the colonists for an enemy when the fellow surprises him , nearly killing him . Fearful , the colonists expel Todd from the community . Apparently rejected by every society he has known , the military and the refugee civilians , Todd shows strong emotion for the first time after being expelled . Overcome by loss , he quietly cries . A short time later , Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by a snake while they sleep , but they are saved by Nathan s use of Todd s aggressive defensive technique to protect them . Now understanding the value of Todd s lesson , they seek him to reintegrate him into the community , regardless of the opposition of the others who fear him . The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet , and , since the world is listed as uninhabited , Colonel Mekum decides to use the colonists ' community as the target in a training exercise . Just after Mace finds Todd , apologizes and invites him back , the soldiers spot Mace and kill him . Though out-manned and outgunned , Todd s years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad . Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them , Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery . Using guerrilla tactics , Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers , including Caine 607 , whom he defeats in vicious hand-to-hand combat by clever tactics rather than mere physical prowess . Panicking , Mekum orders the transport ship s crew , composed of Todd s old squad , to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet . He then orders the ship to lift off , leaving the squad behind . When Captain Church objects , Mekum shoots him in cold blood . Before they can take off as planned , Todd appears , and his old comrades silently side with him over the army that has discarded them . They take over the ship , leaving Mekum and his supportive aides on the planet while they evacuate the remaining colonists . In an attempt to disarm the nuclear device , Mekum accidentally sets it off , killing him and his aides . Todd pilots the ship from Arcadia just ahead of the shockwave and sets course for the Trinity Moons , the colonists ' original destination . When Nathan enters the control room and reaches for Todd , he then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination , while looking out upon the galaxy .
