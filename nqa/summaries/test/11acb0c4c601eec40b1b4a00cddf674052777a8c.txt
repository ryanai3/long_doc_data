In 2003 , Dr. Serena Kogan ( Helena Bonham Carter ) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) to sign over his body for medical research following his execution . One year later , the automated Skynet system is activated , becomes self-aware , begins to perceive humans as a threat , and eradicates much of humanity with nuclear weapons in the event known as Judgment Day . In 2018 , John Connor ( Christian Bale ) leads an attack on a Skynet base , where he discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator , incorporating living tissue ( The T-800 ) . He is the only survivor of the assault after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion . Following Connor s departure , Marcus emerges from the base s wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles , after taking the clothing from a Resistance soldier , who died in the explosion . John returns to Resistance headquarters , located aboard a nuclear submarine , and tells General Ashdown ( Michael Ironside ) of his findings . Meanwhile , the Resistance has discovered a radio signal believed to have been an order to shut down Skynet s machines . Working on this intelligence , the human militia plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days ; in response to an intercepted kill list created by Skynet with a plan to terminate the Resistance s command staff . John Connor learns he is second on this list , following Kyle Reese . The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle s importance , but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father . John returns to his base and meets with his pregnant wife Kate ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) and his second-in-command Barnes ( Common ) . Arriving at the ruins of Los Angeles , Marcus sees a T-600 Terminator and yells at it grasping its attention , but before Marcus is killed he is saved by Kyle Reese ( Anton Yelchin ) and a mute child named Star ( Jadagrace Berry ) . Kyle then signs to Star and she sets off a trap for the T-600 that kills it off . After such , Kyle confronts Marcus with a gun and snaps at him about the blood red ribbon on his left arm ( symboling Resistance ) . Marcus snags Kyle s weapon and points it at him instead asking of the year . Kyle tells Marcus about the war between humanity and Skynet and the year . After , Kyle takes Marcus to their base were Marcus finds a broken radio , he fixes it effortlessly and a broadcast appears on it , after hearing John s radio broadcast the three fall asleep . The three leave in search of others in the Resistance . They survive an attack at a gas station ; yet Kyle , Star , and several other people are taken prisoner . Later , two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport . Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams ( Moon Bloodgood ) and they make their way to Connor s base , where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine . Attempting to save his life , the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is , indeed , a cyborg , with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex . Although Marcus believes himself to be human , John thinks that Marcus has been sent to execute him and , orders him to be killed . Blair helps Marcus escape . During the pursuit , Marcus saves John s life from Skynet s hydrobots and the two make a bargain : Marcus will enter Skynet s headquarters in San Francisco , to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners , if he lets Marcus live . John pleads with the General to delay the offensive defense , but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command . However , the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown s orders and , instead , await John s signal . Marcus enters the base , interfaces with the computer , and disables perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners . Marcus learns from Skynet ( which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen ) that he was created and built to lure John to this base ; when the Resistance launches its attack , John will be killed , achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times before . The radio signal that the Resistance received is revealed to have been a ruse , and Skynet uses it , to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance s leaders aboard . Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 ( Model 101 ) Terminator . Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John revives him , but John is mortally wounded during the fight . Marcus jumps the T-800 when it is distracted and defeats it , while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together several Terminator fuel cells to explode and detonates them as he , Marcus , Kyle , and Star are airlifted out . Kate attempts to save John s life , but his heart is too badly damaged . Marcus offers his own heart for transplant , sacrificing himself to save John . Recovering , John radios to other Resistance fighters that , although this battle has been won , the war is still not over .
