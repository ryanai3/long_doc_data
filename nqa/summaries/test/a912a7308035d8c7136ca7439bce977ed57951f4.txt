Megamind is shown falling at the beginning of the film and he explains how . Megamind was born intelligent and was evacuated from his homeworld as a baby , as was Metro Man ; the two fall into paths of super villainy and superheroism respectively and grow up as rivals fighting for control of Metro City . Megamind is consistently defeated by Metroman and is in prison . After using a holographic watch to escape with the aid of Minion , a talking fish with the robotic body of a gorilla , he kidnaps Metro Man s supposed love interest , reporter Roxanne Ritchi and holds her hostage to lure him into a trap . Finding that copper is Metro Man s one weakness , Megamind s plan to obliterate him with a death ray powered by the sun succeeds , and Megamind finally takes over the city . His joy is short lived though , as without a hero to fight , he finds his life has become meaningless . He goes to the Metroman Museum , which was dedicated to him on the day of his death and nearly runs into Roxanne . He uses his holographic watch to disguise himself as the museum s curator Bernard , and she innocently gives him the idea of creating a new superhero to take Metro Man s place . After creating a formula from Metroman s DNA , Roxanne intervenes in his plans and he accidentally injects the serum into Hal Stewart , Roxanne s dimwitted cameraman , who has an unrequited crush on her . Under the guise of his Space Dad , Megamind tries to mold Hal into a superhero named Titan , as it was the only name he could trademark but this was mishearded by Hal as Tighten . Unfortunately , Hal s ambitions are crushed when he sees Roxanne and Megamind as Bernard on a date . However , Megamind s disguise falters during dinner and she rejects him , causing him to lose track of his invisible car which contains the gun capable of removing Hal s powers . On the day of their planned battle , Hal does n't show up and Megamind finds that he has been using his powers for ill-gotten gains and wants to team up with Megamind to take over Metro City . Megamind tells Hal that he tricked him , revealing his Space Dad and Bernard disguises , which infuriates Hal , and tries to destroy Megamind . Megamind activates a failsafe to trap Hal in copper as it was Metro Man s weakness , but that too fails . After he escapes , Megamind pleads with Roxanne for help , and they go to Metro Man s hideout to search for clues to why the copper did n't work . Instead they find Metro Man , still alive but having felt pushed into life of a superhero , he chose to fake his death so he could retire in order to do something that he wanted to do , pursue a career in music . He refuses to help despite the danger , but encourages Megamind that good will always rise up against evil . Not seeing himself as a hero , Megamind gives up and returns to prison . Meanwhile , Hal kidnaps Roxanne and holds her hostage to call Megamind out of hiding . Megamind begs the Warden to release him to face this threat , inadvertently apologizing for an argument he d had with Minion earlier that caused the two to separate . Minion reveals himself under the Warden s disguise and the two leave to face Hal together . At Metro Tower , Hal threatens to send it toppling into the city with Roxanne tied to the roof . Megamind appears and tricks Hal , freeing Roxanne and the two flee as he throws the tower at them . Roxanne gets away , but Megamind is struck by the tower s antenna and appears near death . Metro Man finally appears and chases Hal away from the scene as Roxanne discovers that the Megamind that saved her was actually Minion , and that Metro Man is actually Megamind in disguise . He successfully intimidates Hal , but accidentally mispronounces the city s name Metro City as Matrocity , as Megamind often did and Hal returns . Finding the invisible car , Megamind grabs the diffuser gun just as Hal hurls him into the sky . To avoid falling to his death , Megamind dehydrates himself and lands in the fountain in front of Hal . He immediately rehydrates ; his de-powering gun lands in his hands and he fires it at Hal , removing the villain s powers and returning him to normal . Now hailed as heroes , Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man s museum , now dedicated to Megamind instead while Metro Man , in disguise within the crowd , silently congratulates his former rival . In a mid-credits scene Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine . After chiding Megamind about cleaning out his pockets , he knocks Bernard out with the Forget-Me Stick .
