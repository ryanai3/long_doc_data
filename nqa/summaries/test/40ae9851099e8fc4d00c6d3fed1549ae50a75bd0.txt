American and Russian Special Forces capture General Ivan Radek ( Jç«¯rgen Prochnow ) , the dictator of a rogue terrorist regime in Kazakhstan that possessed stolen Soviet nuclear weapons , threatening to start a new Cold War . Three weeks after the mission , U.S. President James Marshall ( Harrison Ford ) attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow , during which he praises the capture and insists the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists . Marshall and his entourage , including his wife Grace ( Wendy Crewson ) and daughter Alice ( Liesel Matthews ) , and several of his Cabinet and advisers , prepare to return to the United States on Air Force One . In addition , a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard , including Russian terrorists and Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Ivan Korshunov ( Gary Oldman ) . After takeoff , Secret Service agent Gibbs ( Xander Berkeley ) , who has been a mole , enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane , killing many of the other agents and military personnel before taking the civilians hostage . Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov s men but they are too late to capture him as the pod is ejected . Instead , Korshunov storms the cockpit and prevents the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany , and secures Grace and Alice separately from the other hostages . Several F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards Radek-loyal airspace . Unknown to Korshunov , Marshall , a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient , has remained hidden in the cargo hold instead of using the pod and begins to observe the loyalists using his military training . Marshall manages to kill some of Korshunov s men and then uses a satellite phone to make contact with his Vice President Kathryn Bennett ( Glenn Close ) , letting his staff know he is alive . Korshunov , believing that only a rogue Secret Service agent is in the cargo hold , contacts Bennett and demands Radek s release , threatening to kill a hostage every half hour . Marshall and military advisors devise a plan to trick Korshunov to take Air Force One to a lower altitude for a mid-air refueling , giving time for the hostages to parachute safely off the plane . As a KC-10 tanker docks with Air Force One , Marshall helps to kill another loyalist and escorts the hostages to the cargo hold , where most parachute away ; Marshall insists on staying to rescue his family . Korshunov discovers the deception and forces Air Force One away , causing the fuel to ignite , destroying the tanker ; the shock wave disrupts the escape process , and Korshunov is able to stop Marshall , Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd ( Paul Guilfoyle ) , Major Caldwell ( William H. Macy ) , and Gibbs from escaping . With the President and his family under his control , Korshunov forces Marshall to contact Russian President Petrov and arrange for Radek s release . Bennett is urged by Defense Secretary Walter Dean ( Dean Stockwell ) to declare the President incapable under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment , so as to override Radek s release , but she refuses . While Korushunov and his men celebrate the news of Radek s release , Marshall breaks his bonds and kills Korshunov s last two henchmen before strangling Korshunov and throwing him off the plane when Korshunov tries to escape himself . Marshall races back to lift his order , and Radek is subsequently killed when he attempts to escape . Marshall and Caldwell direct the plane back to friendly airspace , accompanied by the F-15s , only to be quickly tailed by a second batch of Radek loyalists piloting MiG-29s . Marshall is able to evade most of the missile launches ; although one F-15 pilot sacrifices himself to intercept a remaining missile , the resulting explosion damages Air Force One s tail , and the 747 start to lose altitude . A standby U.S. Air Force Rescue HC-130 is called to help , sending parajumpers on tether lines to help rescue the survivors . Marshall insists that his family and the injured Shepherd be transferred first . When there is time for only one more transfer , Gibbs reveals himself as the mole , killing Caldwell and the parajumper . Marshall and Gibbs fight for control of the transfer line , and Marshall manages to grab and detach it at the last minute . Air Force One crashes into the Caspian Sea , killing Gibbs . The HC-130 airmen reel Marshall in , who is safely reunited with his family . The HC-130 is subsequently renamed Air Force One as it flies back to friendly airspace .
