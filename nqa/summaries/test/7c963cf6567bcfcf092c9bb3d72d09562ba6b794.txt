In this adaptation of Jane Austen s Emma , Alicia Silverstone plays Cherilyn Cher Horowitz , a late-20th-century version of Austen s protagonist Emma Woodhouse . Like Emma , Cher is a well-intentioned but somewhat superficial girl who is attractive , popular and extremely wealthy . A few months shy of her sixteenth birthday , she has risen to the top of the high school social scene . She lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel , a ferocious $ 500-an-hour litigator ; her mother died from a freak accident during a routine liposuction procedure when Cher was a baby . Cher s best friend is Dionne Davenport , who is also rich , pretty , and hip , and understands what it s like to be envied . Though Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray , Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor on Dionne s part . Among the few people to find fault with Cher is Josh , her socially-conscious stepbrother , who visits her during a break from college . Josh and Cher spar continually but without malice ; she mocks his scruffy idealism , while he teases her for being selfish , vain , and superficial , and says that her only direction in life is toward the mall . Cher plays matchmaker for two lonely , nerdy , hard-grading teachers , Mr. Hall and Miss Geist . She achieves her ostensible purpose , to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad report card ; but when she sees their newfound happiness , she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds . Cher decides to give back to the community by adopting a tragically unhip new girl at school , Tai Frasier . Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover and initiate her into the mysteries of popularity . Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock , an amiable skateboarding slacker , and to steer her toward Elton , a popular rich snob . Her second matchmaking scheme backfires when Elton rejects Tai and attempts to seduce Cher . When a handsome new student named Christian arrives at their school , Cher takes a shine to him and attempts to secure him as her boyfriend . Eventually , Murray spells it out to her and Dionne that Christian is not interested in her because he is gay . Despite the failure of this endeavor , Cher remains on good terms with Christian , primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion . Matters take a turn for the worse when Cher s project works too well , and Tai s popularity surpasses her own . The situation reaches crisis stage after Cher fails her driver s test and ca n't renegotiate the result . When she returns home , crushed , Tai confides that she s taken a fancy to Josh and wants Cher to help her get him . Cher says she does n't think Josh is right for Tai , and they quarrel . Feeling totally clueless , Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life . After much soul searching , Cher realizes she is romantically interested in Josh . She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life , including captaining the school s Pismo Beach disaster relief effort . Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another , culminating in a tender kiss . In the end , Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed ; Cher s friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified ; Tai and Travis are in love ; and Cher wins a $ 200 bet for catching the bouquet at the wedding . She embraces Josh , and they kiss as the film closes .
