Conan is the son of Corin , chief of a barbarian tribe . The youth is a skilled but violent warrior , who his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword . Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym , a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria . Thousands of years ago , the Mask , crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world , was broken into many pieces , which were scattered among the barbarian tribes . After locating Corin s piece of the mask , and murdering the entire village , Zym leaves . Conan , the only survivor , swears revenge . Years later , Conan has become a pirate but still seeks revenge . He encounters a slave colony and frees it , killing all of the slave handlers in the process . In the city of Messantia , he encounters Ela-Shan , a thief being chased by a man whom Conan recognizes as Lucius , one of Zym s soldiers from years before . He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan . Conan escapes imprisonment , kills several of the guards , and confronts Lucius , forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl , the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron ; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the body of the girl will unleash the mask s power . Conan helps the rest of the prisoners to escape , and , in gratitude , Ela-Shan tells Conan that , if he ever needs him , Conan will find him at the City of Thieves , Argalon . Lucius is then killed by the prisoners . Zym and his daughter , the sorceress Marique , attack a monastery where they hope to find the pure-blood descendant . Sensing something is wrong , Fassir , an elderly monk , tells one of his students , Tamara , to run away and return to her birthplace . When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant , Zym kills him . Marique also slays several of the priestesses . Tamara s carriage is chased by Zym s men , but Conan rescues her , kills three of her pursuers , and captures one of Zym s men , Remo . After forcing him to reveal Tamara s importance as the pure-blood , Conan catapults Remo into Zym s nearby camp , killing him . Zym and Marique confront Conan , who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold . Conan attacks Zym , but Marique assists her father by invoking soldiers made of sand , and poisons Conan with a poison-laced boomerang sword . Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan s ship , stationed nearby , where his friend Artus helps Conan recover . The boat is attacked by Zym s men , but although they kill several of Conan s men , they are defeated . Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom . Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him , meeting with him in a cave , where they have sex . The next day , as she is returning to the boat , Zym s men and daughter capture her . Conan learns of Tamara s capture and departs to Argalon , where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym s castle unnoticed . Zym prepares to drain Tamara s blood , mending the mask . He plans to use the girl s body as a vessel for his wife s soul . After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers , Conan infiltrates Zym s followers , kills a guard , steals his robe , and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask . Conan releases Tamara , and she escapes as he battles Zym , eventually reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father . Marique attacks Tamara , but Conan hears Tamara s scream and defeats Marique , cutting off her hand . Tamara kicks her into a pit , where she is impaled . Zym swears revenge upon Conan . Conan and Tamara become trapped on an unstable bridge as Zym attacks them . He uses the mask s power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife , Maliva , a powerful sorceress who was executed by the monks from Tamara s monastery for attempting to unleash occult forces to destroy Hyborea , and Maliva s spirit begins to possess Tamara s body . She begs Conan to let her fall , but he refuses and instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara . The power-hungry ruler falls into the lava below the precipice crying out to his wife . Conan and Tamara escape and he returns her to her birthplace , telling her that they ll meet again . He then returns to Corin s village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him , restoring his honor .
