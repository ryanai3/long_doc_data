During a particularly intense Florida heatwave , inept lawyer Ned Racine ( William Hurt ) begins an affair with Matty ( Kathleen Turner ) , the wife of wealthy businessman Edmund Walker ( Richard Crenna ) . They go to great lengths to keep their affair a secret , but Ned carelessly propositions an old school friend of Matty , Mary Ann Simpson ( Kim Zimmer ) , thinking she was Matty . Matty soon makes it clear to Ned that she wants to leave Edmund but also wants his money , explaining that a divorce would leave her with very little due to their prenuptial agreement . Racine suggests the only option is to kill Edmund . While planning the murder , Ned consults one of his shadier clients , Teddy Lewis ( Mickey Rourke ) , an expert on incendiary devices , who supplies him with a bomb . Racine drives to the Walker estate at night to kill Edmund . He places the body in an abandoned building in which Edmund had a business interest , and uses the incendiary device to make it look like he died during a botched arson job . Ned is contacted by Edmund s lawyer about a new will that Racine supposedly drew up on Edmund s behalf , which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson . The new will is so poorly prepared it is declared null and void , resulting in Matty inheriting the entire fortune . Matty later admits to Ned that she forged the will . Two of Ned s friends , assistant deputy prosecutor Peter Lowenstein ( Ted Danson ) and police detective Oscar Grace ( J.A . Preston ) begin to suspect Ned of involvement with Matty in her husband s death . The men reveal to Ned that Edmund s steel-rim glasses , which he always wore , were not on him at the time of the explosion , and are nowhere to be found . Mary Ann Simpson has also disappeared . Nervous about the will , the glasses , the suspicions of the police , and Matty s loyalty , Ned happens upon a lawyer who once sued him over a mishandled legal case . The lawyer reveals that to make amends , he recommended Ned to Matty Walker , and admits to telling her about Ned s lack of competence as a lawyer . Lowenstein warns Ned that someone kept calling his hotel room on the night of the murder but never got an answer , thereby weakening his alibi . Lewis tells Ned that a woman came to him for another incendiary device , and he showed her how to booby trap a door . Matty calls Ned to tell him the glasses are in the boathouse on the Walker estate . Ned goes to the boathouse late at night and sees a long twisted wire attached to the door . When Matty shows up , Ned confronts her at gunpoint and tells her to get the glasses . Matty walks toward the boathouse and disappears from view ; the boathouse explodes . Grace finds a body that is identified as Matty Walker ( nĂŠe Tyler ) through dental records . Now in prison , Ned tries to convince Grace that Matty is still alive , laying out for him the scenario that the woman he knew as Matty assumed the identity of Matty Tyler in order to marry Edmund and get his money . The woman Ned knew as Mary Ann Simpson discovered this and played along but was then murdered and her body left in the boathouse . Had Ned been killed by entering the boathouse , the police would have found both suspects dead , and Matty would have gotten away with the money . Remembering that Matty told him when and where she had attended high school in Illinois , Ned writes to the school asking for the yearbook . Ned finds the pictures of Mary Ann Simpson and Matty Tyler , confirming his suspicion that Mary Ann Simpson stole Matty Tyler s identity , eventually becoming Matty Walker . Below the real Matty s picture is the nickname Smoocher and AmbitionâTo Graduate ; below Mary Ann s is the nickname The Vamp , swim-team membership , and AmbitionâTo be rich and live in an exotic land . Mary Ann is last seen seated on a comfortable chair on a tropical beach . Reclining beside her is a man who speaks to her in Spanish . Lost in thought , Mary Ann turns away from him , puts on her sunglasses and faces the sun .
