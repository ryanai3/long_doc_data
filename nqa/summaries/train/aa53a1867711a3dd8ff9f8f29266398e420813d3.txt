In 2044 , 25-year-old Joe works for a Kansas City crime syndicate as a looper . Since future technology has made it near-impossible to dispose of bodies , the syndicate uses time travel , invented thirty years later and outlawed instantly . Managed by a future man named Abe Mitchell , loopers kill and dispose of face-concealed victims , and are paid with silver bars strapped to the target . To prevent connections to the syndicate , loopers kill their future selves with gold bars strapped to them when they retire , effectively ending the contract and closing the loop . Joe s friend Seth , part of a minority that manifest low-level telekinesis ( or TK ) , confides that his old self has escaped , after warning him of a person in the future called the Rainmaker who will overthrow the five major bosses and close all loops . Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment s floor safe , but is taken to Abe by Kid Blue , one of Abe s elite Gat Men . Joe reveals Seth s location instead of forfeiting half his silver , and Abe s men cut an address into younger Seth s arm , then begin severing body parts . As Old Seth s limbs disappear , he goes to the address and is killed . When Joe s next target arrives , it is his older self with his face uncovered . Before Joe can kill him , Old Joe shields himself , knocks younger Joe unconscious and escapes . Returning to his apartment , Young Joe fights with Kid Blue , only to fall off a fire escape and black out . In another timeline , Young Joe kills his older self as he arrives . He moves to Shanghai , where his drug addiction and partying persist , becoming a hitman to finance himself . Years later , he meets a woman during a bar fight and they marry . Thirty years after , Joe is taken to close the loop and his wife is killed in the process . Overpowering his captors , Joe sends himself back to 2044 thereby altering history . When Old Joe sees Young Joe fall , he shoots the Gat Men and drags him away . Old Joe begins to manifest vague memories of Young Joe s actions in the present , and meets his younger self at a diner to explain that he intends to save his wife by killing the Rainmaker as a child . Kid Blue and several other Gat Men arrive at the diner and a gunfight ensues : Young Joe collects a corner of Old Joe s map as both escape . Young Joe follows the map to a farm where Sara and her son Cid live . Sara recognizes the number on the map as Cid s birthday and birth hospital s code . Young Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three children born at the hospital that day , not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker , so he waits at the farm to protect Cid and Sara . Jesse , another Gat Man , comes looking for both Joes at the farm , but Cid and Young Joe hide in an underground tunnel . Later that night Sara and Young Joe have sex , and Sara reveals she has TK powers . Cid s powers are revealed to be even stronger , with Sara hiding in a safe when he has a tantrum . In the morning , Young Joe wakes to find Jesse holding Sara at gunpoint in the living room . Frightened , Cid falls down the stairs and telekinetically destroys Jesse . Young Joe realizes that Cid will become the Rainmaker , using his powers to control the city , and that Old Joe will now know this from his memories . Kid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe . Old Joe breaks free and kills Abe and his henchmen , then travels to Sara s farm . While Young Joe kills Kid Blue , Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid . Cid s cheek is grazed by Old Joe s bullet , and he creates a telekinetic blast , but is calmed by Sara before he can kill them . Telling Cid to run into the cane field , Sara stands between Old Joe and her son . Young Joe realizes that Cid s mother s death will turn him into the Rainmaker and commits suicide , erasing Old Joe s existence , saving Sara and preventing Cid from becoming the Rainmaker .
