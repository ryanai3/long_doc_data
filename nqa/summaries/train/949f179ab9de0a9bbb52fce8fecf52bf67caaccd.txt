Unlucky Bernie Lootz ( William H. Macy ) has little positive going for him : he lives in a dreary place -- a studio apartment in a run-down motel near the Las Vegas Strip ; he ca n't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman ; he s indebted to the Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow ( Alec Baldwin ) , who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap . Kaplow had also paid Lootz ' casino debts , and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off . Lootz is weary of the casino business , and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon . His future success as a luck cooler is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario ( Maria Bello ) seemingly takes an interest in him , and his luck — and that of those around him — takes a turn for the better . What Bernie does n't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La . What Shelly does n't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie , and vice versa . Additional complications arise when Shelly , a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas , resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers , including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov ( Ron Livingston ) , to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century . Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town , and , with his wife , is interfering with the operations at the Shangri La . Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates , such as gangster Nicky Fingers , the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves .
