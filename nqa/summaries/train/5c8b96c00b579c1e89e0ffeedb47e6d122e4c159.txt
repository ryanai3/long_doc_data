Earl Brooks ( Kevin Costner ) is a wealthy , successful businessman recently honored by the Portland , Oregon Chamber of Commerce as Man of the Year . However , Brooks lives a secret life as a serial killer , known as the Thumbprint Killer . Brooks has abstained from murder for the past two years by attending twelve-step meetings for addicts , to try and cope with his killing addiction . He feels the compulsion to kill rising again , however , as his id , Marshall ( William Hurt ) , becomes more insistent . Brooks gives in to his addiction and kills a young couple while they are having sex in their house and , as part of his psychopathology , leaves each of the victims ' bloody thumbprints on a lampshade . Brooks follows his meticulous modus operandi , including fastidious preparation , cleaning up the crime scene , even locking the doors before departing , and burning the clothes he was wearing during the killings . Marshall then realizes that the couple s curtains were open , facing an apartment building . Brooks ' daughter Jane ( Danielle Panabaker ) unexpectedly arrives home , having dropped out of college in Palo Alto , California . She visits Brooks at work and mentions that she would like to get a job with his company . The same day , a man calling himself Mister Smith ( Dane Cook ) turns up at Brooks ' work and blackmails him with photographs of Brooks at the most recent murder . Smith demands that Brooks take him along on a murder , to which Brooks reluctantly agrees . Brooks ' wife , Emma ( Marg Helgenberger ) , reveals that Jane dropped out of college because she is pregnant . The Brookses are then visited by detectives from Palo Alto who want to interview Jane about a murder committed in her former dorm building . Marshall and Brooks realize that Jane committed the murder and consider letting her go to jail to save her from becoming like them . Eventually , however , Brooks uses an alternate identity , flies to Palo Alto , and commits a similar murder to make it appear as if a serial killer is loose , thereby exonerating Jane . Brooks researches the background of the police officer chasing the Thumbprint Killer , Detective Tracy Atwood ( Demi Moore ) , and discovers she s in the middle of an agonizing divorce from Jesse Vialo ( Jason Lewis ) . Brooks decides that Vialo and his lawyer , Sheila ( Reiko Aylesworth ) , will be Smith s first victims . At the scene of the Vialo murder , Smith wets his pants in a fit of panic , leaving his DNA for the police to discover later . While driving away from the scene , Smith pulls a gun on Brooks , which Brooks and Marshall had predicted would happen . Brooks explains to Smith that he knows he ca n't stop killing , and so plans to commit suicide to spare his family the shame of his being caught . Brooks takes Smith to a cemetery he owns , and explains that they will find an open grave . Smith will shoot Brooks and then cover him with just enough dirt to mask the body . The next day , a casket will be lowered into the grave and covered , and Brooks ' body will never be discovered . Smith attempts to shoot Brooks , but Brooks reveals that , at some point prior , he had broken into Smith s apartment and bent the firing pin on Smith s pistol , rendering it inoperable on the off-chance that Brooks would change his mind . Brooks ' brush with death makes him realize he wants to live to see his grandchild , and he turns on his would-be murderer , slitting Smith s throat with a shovel and hiding his body in the open grave . With Smith s urine providing the only DNA evidence of the Thumbprint Killer at a murder scene , Brooks will remain undetected . Smith is named as the Thumbprint Killer and Brooks returns to his normal life . Knowing he is in the clear , Brooks calls Detective Atwood , whom he has come to admire , to ask her why she is a police officer . She replies that her wealthy father had wanted a boy , and she wanted to succeed in spite of him . Atwood is unable to trace the call before Brooks hangs up , but she is puzzled as she realises Smith was not the voice on the line and that they may have fingered the wrong guy . That night , Brooks has a nightmare in which Jane murders him , suggesting that he fears Jane will become like him .
