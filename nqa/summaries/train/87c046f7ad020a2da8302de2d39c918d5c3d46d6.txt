The Minutemen , a team of costumed crime fighters , was formed in 1939 in response to a rise in costumed gangs and criminals ; the Watchmen was similarly formed decades later . Their existence has dramatically affected world events : Doctor Manhattan s powers have helped the United States win the Vietnam War , and given the West a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union , which by 1985 threatens to escalate the Cold War into a nuclear war . Growing anti-vigilante sentiment leads to masked crime-fighters being outlawed . While many of the heroes retire , Dr Manhattan and The Comedian operate as government-sanctioned agents , and Rorschach continues to operate outside the law . While investigating the murder of government agent Edward Blake , Rorschach discovers that Blake was the Comedian , and theorizes that someone may be attempting to eliminate former costumed heroes . He warns his retired comradesâ Daniel Dreiberg ( Nite Owl II ) , Dr Manhattan , and the latter s lover Laurie Jupiter ( Silk Spectre II ) . Dr Manhattan ignores Rorschach , and Dreiberg is skeptical , but relays this information to vigilante-turned-billionaire Adrian Veidt ( Ozymandias ) , who also dismisses it . Following a backlash , Dr Manhattan exiles himself to Mars , giving the Soviet Union the confidence to invade Afghanistan . Rorschach s theory appears to be justified when Veidt narrowly avoids an assassination attempt , and Rorschach finds himself framed for the murder of a former villain named Moloch . When Rorschach is arrested , his identity is revealed to be Walter Kovacs , and he is sent to jail . Jupiter goes to stay with Dreiberg after breaking up with Manhattan . The two become lovers and decide to come out of retirement . After helping Rorschach break out of prison , Jupiter is confronted by Manhattan , who transports her to Mars . As he probes her memories , he discovers that she is Blake s daughter , and realizes the miracle of her life , created in spite of her parents ' turbulent relationship . He then returns to Earth with her . Investigating the conspiracy , Rorschach and Dreiberg discover that Veidt is behind everything . Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal , which he drops off at the publication office of the New Frontiersman , a right-wing tabloid . Rorschach and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat . Veidt admits to being responsible for Blake s murder , Manhattan s exile , Rorschach s framing , and his own assassination attempt , which he staged to divert suspicion . He explains that his plan is to unify the United States and the Soviet Union by destroying the world s main cities with exploding energy reactors infused with energy from Manhattan . Rorschach and Dreiberg attempt to stop him , but Veidt subdues them both and reveals that his plan has already been set into motion : the reactors have been detonated , and the energy signatures are recognized as Manhattan s . Jupiter and Manhattan arrive in a destroyed New York City and determine that Veidt is responsible . They teleport to his base , causing him to retreat and attempt to kill Manhattan . Unsuccessful , he shows them a televised news report in which Nixon states that the United States and Soviet Union have allied against their new common enemy : Dr Manhattan . Although his allies realize that revealing the truth would only disrupt this new peace , Rorschach refuses to compromise , and attempts to return to America to expose Veidt . Manhattan intervenes , and Rorschach demands that Manhattan kill him to keep him from revealing the truth . Manhattan complies . Manhattan shares a final kiss with Jupiter before departing permanently to another galaxy , while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt , who makes no effort to defend himself . Nevertheless , he defends his actions , claiming that for world peace to be possible , there had to be sacrifice . Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity . Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime . Later , an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that , as the world is at peace , there is nothing to report on . The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings , among which is Rorschach s journal .
