Ten years after tracking and taking down serial killer Jame Gumb , FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is unjustly blamed for a botched drug raid . She is later contacted by Mason Verger , the only surviving victim of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter . A wealthy child molester , Verger was paralyzed and horribly disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session . He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture , torture , and kill Lecter ever since . Using his wealth and political influence , Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter s case , hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out . After learning of Starling s public disgrace , Lecter sends her a taunting letter . Starling detects a strange fragrance from the letter . A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream whose ingredients are only available to a few shops in the world . She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located , requesting surveillance tapes . In Florence , one of said cities , Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator . Pazzi questions Lecter , who is masquerading as Dr. Fell , the assistant curator and caretaker . Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape , Pazzi accesses the ViCAP database of wanted fugitives . He then learns of Verger s US $ 3 million personal bounty on Lecter . Blinded by greed , Pazzi ignores Starling s warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone . He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter s fingerprint to show Verger as proof . The pickpocket , mortally wounded by Lecter , manages to get the print and provides it to Pazzi . Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio , ties him up , then disembowels and hangs him . He then heads back to the United States . Verger bribes Justice Department official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter , leading to her suspension . Lecter lures Starling to Union Station . Verger s men , having trailed Starling , capture and bring Lecter to Verger . Verger means to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose . After her superiors refuse to act , Starling infiltrates Verger s estate . After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter she is shot by a third guard that was in hiding . Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors , they are on their way out when Verger arrives . He orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter , but with Lecter s suggestion , Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen . Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive . Lecter takes Starling to Krendler s secluded lake house and treats her wounds . When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July , Lecter subdues and drugs him . Starling , disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet evening gown , awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner . Weakened by the drugs , she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler s prefrontal cortex , sautĂŠs it , and feeds it to him . After the meal , Starling tries to attack Lecter but he overpowers her and the two share a kiss . Starling then handcuffs his wrist to hers . Hearing the police closing in , Lecter uses a meat cleaver to sever his own wrist in order to free their cuffed hands and escapes . Lecter is later seen on a flight with his own boxed lunch . As he prepares to eat his meal , including what is assumed to be part of a cooked brain , a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food . Initially reluctant , Lecter then lets the boy eat some of his lunch .
