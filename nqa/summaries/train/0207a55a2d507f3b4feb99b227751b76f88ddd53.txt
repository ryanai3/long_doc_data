In December 1995 , Chuck Noland ( Tom Hanks ) is a time-obsessed systems engineer , who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots . He is in a long-term relationship with Kelly Frears ( Helen Hunt ) , with whom he lives in Memphis , Tennessee . Although the couple wants to get married , Chuck s busy schedule interferes with their relationship . A Christmas with relatives is interrupted when Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia . While flying through a violent storm , his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean . Chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an inflatable life-raft but loses the raft s emergency locator transmitter . He clings to the life-raft , loses consciousness , and floats all night before being washed up on an island . After he awakens , he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited . Several FedEx packages from the crashed plane wash up on the shore , as well as the corpse of one of the pilots , which he buries . He initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life-raft but can not pass the powerful surf and the coral reefs surrounding the island . He searches for food , water , shelter , and opens the packages , finding a number of potentially useful items . He leaves one package , with a pair of angel wings stenciled on it , unopened . During a first attempt to make fire , Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand . In anger and pain , he throws several objects , including a Wilson volleyball from one of the packages . A short time later he draws a face in the bloody hand print on the ball , names it Wilson , and begins talking to it . One night , Chuck calculates that in order for the rescue workers to find the site of the plane crash , they ll have to search an area twice the size of Texas , making him doubtful he will ever be found . Four years later , Chuck is dramatically thinner , bearded , with longer hair , and wearing a loincloth . He has become adept at spearing fish and making fires . He also has regular conversations and arguments with Wilson , his volleyball friend which has become his only means of socialization . A large section from a portable toilet washes up on the island ; Chuck uses it as a sail in the construction of a raft . After spending some time building and stocking the raft and deciding when the weather conditions will be optimal ( using an analemma he has created in his cave to monitor the time of year ) , he launches , using the sail to overcome the powerful surf . After some time on the ocean , a storm nearly tears his raft apart . The following day , Wilson falls from the raft and is cast away into the ocean , leaving Chuck crying and overwhelmed by loneliness . Later , a passing cargo ship finds him , drifting . Upon returning to civilization , Chuck learns that he has long been given up for dead ; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral , and Kelly has since married Chuck s one-time endodontist and has a daughter . After reuniting with Kelly , the pair profess their love for each other but , realizing they ca n't be together because of her commitment to her new family ( and also remembering that Chuck was n't there for her last time ) , they sadly part . Kelly gives Chuck the keys to the car they once shared . Sometime later , after buying a new volleyball , Chuck travels to Canadian , Texas to return the unopened FedEx package with the angel wings to its sender , a woman named Bettina Peterson . The house at the address is empty , so he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life . He departs and stops at a remote crossroads . A friendly woman ( Lari White ) passing by in a pickup truck stops to explain where each road leads . As she drives away , Chuck notices the angel wings on the back of her truck is identical to the one on the parcel . As Chuck is left standing at the crossroads he looks down each road , then smiles faintly as he looks in the direction of the woman s truck .
