From a prison cell where he has been charged for murder , David Aames ( Tom Cruise ) , in a prosthetic mask , tells his life story to court psychologist , Dr. Curtis McCabe ( Kurt Russell ) . In flashback , David is shown to be the wealthy owner of a large publishing firm in New York City which he inherited from his father , leaving its regular duties to his father s trusted associates . As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle , he is introduced to Sofia Serrano ( PenĂŠlope Cruz ) by his best friend , author Brian Shelby ( Jason Lee ) at a party . David and Sofia spend a night together talking and fall in love . When David s former lover , Julianna Julie Gianni ( Cameron Diaz ) , hears of Sofia , she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash . Julie dies but David survives , his face grotesquely disfigured , leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries . With no hope to use plastic surgery to repair the damage , David can not come to grips with the idea of wearing the mask for the rest of his life . On a night out with Sofia and Brian , David gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian leave David to wallow in the street outside . David is awakened the next day in the street by Sofia , who apologises for deserting him the night before , and takes him home . The two continue to see each other , and David has his face surgically repaired despite being told it was impossible before . Though his life seems perfectly content , David finds oddities , such as brief visions of his distorted face , and a man ( Noah Taylor ) at a bar that tells him David can control the world and everyone in it , if he wanted to . One day , when he goes to Sofia s apartment , he finds Julie there instead ; all of the previous mementos of Sofia now show Julie s face . Angry and confused , David suffocates Julie , and is later arrested and placed in a mental institution , finding his face has reverted to its previously disfigured state . David completes telling his story to Curtis , who proceeds to then visit David further for more sessions to try to help him recuperate . During one interview Curtis tells David the staff reported him calling out Ellie in a bad dream and asks who she is . David later sees a nearby TV advertisement for Life Extension , a company that specializes in cryonic suspension , and realises he d actually called out L , E . Under Curtis ' and a police officer s guard , David is taken to the Life Extension offices , where the salesclerk Rebecca ( Tilda Swinton ) explains they freeze people just after the point of death , until a cure for their ailment is available in the future , keeping their brain active by placing them in a lucid dream state . David becomes anxious and breaks free of Curtis , realizing he is in his own lucid dream that has gone wrong , and calls for tech support . David finds himself in the empty lobby of the offices , and the man whom he saw earlier at the bar appears , claiming to be David s tech support from Life Extension , which is now known as the Oasis Project . They ride up in an elevator to the top of an impossibly tall building , the height triggering David s severe acrophobia . The man explains that David has been in cryonic sleep for 150 years . David had opted for Life Extension s services after struggling with his breakup with Sofia and his disfigurement , and after securing the publishing company to its associates , proceeded to kill himself with a drug overdose ; Life Extension preserved his body and , as David directed , put him into his lucid dream starting from the drunken night when Sofia left him , under the vanilla sky from a Monet painting . However , during his sleep , the dream went horribly wrong and attempted to incorporate elements from his subconscious , such as substituting Julie for Sofia and creating a father-figure in Curtis . As they arrive at the top of the building , the man offers David a choice : either to be reinserted into the corrected lucid dream , or return to the real world by taking a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep . David decides to wake up , ignoring the vision of Curtis that his subconscious has brought to life to talk him out of it . David envisions Sofia and Brian to say his goodbyes . Conquering his final fear , David jumps off the building , his life flashing before his eyes , and whites out immediately before hitting the ground . A female voice commands him to open your eyes ( a recurring theme in the movie ) , and the film ends with David opening his eyes .
