In 1981 , Forrest Gump ( Tom Hanks ) sits at a bus stop in Savannah , Georgia . As a feather floats down toward him , he picks it up and recalls his childhood in Greenbow , Alabama during the 1950s , being raised by a single mother ( Sally Field ) , and having to wear leg braces . Despite being intellectually challenged , Forrest is admitted to public school . On his first day of school , Forrest meets Jenny Curran , who becomes his best friend and is also a victim of child molestation . With Jenny s encouragement , Forrest runs away from a group of bullies , struggling until his leg braces break off and he is able to run very fast . Years later , while fleeing the same group of bullies , he runs onto a football field during a practice observed by legendary coach Paul Bear Bryant , which gets him into the University of Alabama on a football scholarship and eventually meets President John F Kennedy as a member of the NCAA All-American team . After graduation , he enlists in the army , where he excels at drill exercises and befriends fellow recruit Benjamin Buford Blue , nicknamed Bubba ( Mykelti Williamson ) , an aspiring shrimp boat captain who suggests they go into the shrimp business together after the war . They are sent to Vietnam under Lieutenant Dan Taylor ( Gary Sinise ) . Bubba is killed during an ambush which leaves many of their fellow soldiers wounded . Lieutenant Dan sustains major injuries and loses both his legs . Forrest is wounded in the buttocks while saving members of his platoon and is awarded the Medal of Honor , presented to him by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House . At an anti-war rally in Washington , Forrest reunites with Jenny , who has joined the Hippie movement after being expelled from college over topless photos of herself and experimenting with drugs . While recovering from his wounds , Forrest discovers an aptitude for ping-pong , eventually playing against the Chinese in ping-pong diplomacy . He runs into Lieutenant Dan , who is now in a wheelchair and has become an embittered drunk and receives Disability pension . Forrest moves in with Dan and they spend the holidays together , with Forrest explaining his and Bubba s plan to go into the shrimping business and his intentions to fulfill Bubba s dream , and meeting President Nixon and causing the Watergate scandal . After being discharged from the Army , Gump returns to Alabama and makes US $ 25,000 from ping pong endorsements , which he uses to buy a shrimping boat , fulfilling his promise to Bubba . Lieutenant Dan joins Gump , and although they initially have little success , after Hurricane Carmen they are the only boat in the area left standing , and they begin to pull in huge amounts of shrimp . They use their income to buy an entire fleet of shrimp boats . Lieutenant Dan invests the money in Apple and they are financially secure for the rest of their lives . Forrest returns home when his mother falls terminally ill and stays with her until her death . Forrest donates much of his money to various causes and continues to live in the house where he grew up , taking a job as a grounds keeper . However he is lonely and often thinks of Jenny , who has been living a life of promiscuity and substance abuse . One day , she returns to Alabama and stays with Forrest . He asks her to marry him , but she declines due to her troubled past . However , they make love that night . After she leaves the next day , Forrest decides to go for a run , which turns into a coast-to-coast three-and-a-half year journey , bringing him national attention . In present-day , Gump reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny , who is now living in Savannah and had seen him on TV during his running and invited him to visit . Jenny reveals Forrest to be the father of her child , also named Forrest , and that she is suffering from an unknown virus ( presumably HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis C as both were unknown diseases at the time and could be spread through intravenous drug use ) . Jenny proposes to Forrest , and he accepts . Forrest and Jenny return to Greenbow with Forrest Jr and are finally married ; Lt. Dan attends the wedding with his fiancĂŠe Susan and has new prosthetic legs . Jenny eventually dies of her illness and Forrest becomes a devoted father to Forrest Jr. Later , Gump is waiting with his son for the school bus to pick him up for his first day of school . As the bus departs , the feather from the beginning of the film floats off into the air .
