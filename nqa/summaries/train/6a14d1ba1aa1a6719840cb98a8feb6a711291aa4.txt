In 2009 , American geologist Adrian Helmsley visits astrophysicist Satnam Surtani in India and learns that neutrinos from a huge solar flare are heating Earth s core . Helmsley presents his information to White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser , who brings him to meet the president . The following year , U.S. President Thomas Wilson and other world leaders begin a secret project to ensure the survival of humanity . China and the G8 nations begin building nine arks , each capable of carrying 100,000 people , in the Himalayas near Cho Ming , Tibet . Nima , a Buddhist monk , is evacuated and his brother Tenzin joins the ark project . Funding is raised by selling tickets at âŹ1Â billion per person . By 2011 , articles of value are moved to the arks with the help of art expert and First Daughter Laura Wilson . In 2012 , struggling Los Angeles science-fiction writer Jackson Curtis is a chauffeur for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov . Jackson s former wife ( Kate ) and their children ( Noah and Lilly ) live with Kate s boyfriend , plastic surgeon and pilot Gordon Silberman . Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park . When they find an area fenced off by the Army , Jackson and his children climb over the fence . They are caught and brought to the geologist Adrian , who has read Jackson s books . After they are released they meet Charlie Frost , who hosts a radio show from the park . After Jackson and his children leave , Adrian learns that the Earth is about to undergo drastic changes in a few hours , realizing that it came much earlier than expected , as only three of the arks have been completed by this time . That night , after the military evacuates Yellowstone , Jackson watches Charlie s video of Charles Hapgood s theory that polar shifts and the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predict a 2012 phenomenon . According to Charlie , anyone who attempted to inform the public was killed . Soon after Jackson and his children return home , he delivers Yuri s sons Alec and Oleg to the airport . After the two express that they will live and he will die , Jackson rents a plane and rushes back to his family , realizing that Charlie was right . He rescues his family as the Earth-crust displacement begins and escapes from Los Angeles by air as California sinks into the Pacific Ocean . They fly to Yellowstone to retrieve a map from Charlie with the arks ' location . As they leave , the Yellowstone Caldera erupts ; Charlie is killed when he stays behind to cover the eruption . The group lands in Las Vegas to find a larger plane and meet Yuri , his twin sons Alec and Oleg , his girlfriend Tamara and their pilot Sasha , who are unable to leave because the airport is refusing to let them . Sasha an Antonov An-500 and pilots it with Gordon , and leave just as the Yellowstone ash cloud engulfs Las Vegas . Adrian , Carl and Laura fly to the arks on Air Force One . Knowing that his daughter will survive , President Wilson remains in the capital to address the nation for the last time while millions of people die in earthquakes and megatsunamis worldwide . With the presidential line of succession gone , Carl assumes the position of acting commander-in-chief . In the Pacific Ocean , a megatsunami strikes the Genesis and kills everyone on board , including Adrian s father . Yuri informs Jackson that he plans to stop at Hawaii to refuel , but this is cut short when they find that Hawaii has been engulfed in lava , forcing them to continue without the needed fuel , and arrive at China . Sasha continues flying the plane as the others escape on a Bentley Continental Flying Spur stored in the cargo hold . Sasha is killed when the plane crashes , and the others are spotted by Chinese Air Force helicopters . Yuri and his sons ( who have tickets ) are brought to the arks and the Curtis family , Tamara and Gordon are left behind . The remaining group is picked up by Nima and brought to the arks with his grandparents . With Tenzin s help they stow away on Ark 4 , where the U.S. contingent is located . As a megatsunami breaches the Himalayas and approaches the site , an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears . This keeps a boarding gate open , which prevents the ship s engines from starting . In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt to board the ships , Yuri , Tamara and Gordon are killed . Tenzin is injured , the ark begins filling with water and is set adrift . Carl wants to leave immediately , but Adrian manages to persuade the heads of state to let the people outside in . Ark 4 attempts to leave , but the lodged impact driver prevents it from doing so . Jackson and Noah dislodge the tool , and the crew of Ark 4 barely manages to regain control of the Ark before it smashes into Mount Everest . Jackson is reunited with his family and reconciles with Kate . Twenty-seven days later , the waters are receding . The arks approach the Cape of Good Hope , where the Drakensberg ( now the tallest mountain range on Earth ) is emerging . Adrian and Laura begin a relationship , and Jackson and Kate rekindle their romance .
