In Kraków during World War II , the Germans had forced local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Kraków Ghetto . Oskar Schindler , an ethnic German , arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune . A member of the Nazi Party , Schindler lavishes bribes on Wehrmacht ( German armed forces ) and SS officials and acquires a factory to produce enamelware . To help him run the business , Schindler enlists the aid of Itzhak Stern , a local Jewish official who has contacts with black marketeers and the Jewish business community . Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory . Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as Herr Direktor , and Stern handles administration . Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less , while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort , which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed . SS-Untersturmführer ( second lieutenant ) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of Płaszów concentration camp . When the camp is completed , he orders the ghetto liquidated . Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto . Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected . He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis , and later sees her body ( identifiable by the red coat ) among those on a wagon load of corpses . Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and , through bribery and lavish gifts , continues to enjoy SS support . Göth brutally mistreats his maid and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa , and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives . As time passes , Schindler s focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible . To better protect his workers , Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp . As the Germans begin to lose the war , Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp . Schindler asks Göth to allow him to move his workers to a new munitions factory he plans to build in his home town of Zwittau-Brinnlitz . Göth agrees , but charges a huge bribe . Schindler and Stern create Schindler s List – a list of people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz . The train carrying the women and children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau ; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss , the commandant of Auschwitz , with a bag of diamonds to win their release . At the new factory , Schindler forbids the SS guards to enter the production rooms and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath . He spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies ; his factory does not produce any usable armaments during its seven months of operation . Schindler runs out of money in 1945 , just as Germany surrenders , ending the war in Europe . As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer , Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture . The SS guards in Schindler s factory have been ordered to kill the Jews , but Schindler persuades them not to , so that they can return to their families as men , instead of murderers . He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west , hoping to surrender to the Americans . The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role saving Jewish lives , together with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation : Whoever saves one life saves the world entire . Schindler is touched but is also deeply ashamed , as he feels he should have done even more . As the Schindlerjuden ( Schindler Jews ) wake up the next morning , a Soviet soldier announces that they have been liberated . The Jews leave the factory and walk to a nearby town . Following scenes depicting Göth s execution after the war and a summary of Schindler s later life , the black-and-white frame changes to a color shot of actual Schindlerjuden at Schindler s grave in Jerusalem . Accompanied by the actors who portrayed them , the Schindlerjuden place stones on the grave . In the final shot , Neeson places a pair of roses on the grave .
