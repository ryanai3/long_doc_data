The film tells the story of Jackie Robinson and , under the guidance of team executive Branch Rickey , Robinson s signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers to become the first African-American player to break the baseball color barrier . The story focuses mostly on the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season and somewhat on Robinson s 1946 season with the Montreal Royals , which emphasize his battles with racism . In 1945 , after sportswriter Wendell Smith suggests that Rickey consider Robinson as the black ballplayer Rickey is looking for , Robinson and his team , the Kansas City Monarchs , stop by a gas station . When the attendant refuses Robinson entry to the washroom , Robinson says they will find another station at which to fill up the team bus , and the attendant relents . As Robinson steps out , a scout for the Dodgers sent by Rickey approaches him and invites him to Brooklyn . He is offered a $ 600 per month contract and a $ 3,500 signing bonus , which Robinson accepts after being warned by Rickey that he must control his temper if he wants to play . Robinson proposes to his girlfriend , Rachel , by phone and she accepts . During spring training , Robinson makes it to the franchise farm team in Montreal . After a great season there and spring training in Panama , he advances to the Dodgers . Most of the team soon signs a petition , stating they refuse to play with Robinson , but manager Leo Durocher insists Robinson will play with the main team . When Durocher is suspended for actions in his personal life , leaving the Dodgers without a manager to start the regular season , Burt Shotton agrees to manage the team . In a game against the Philadelphia Phillies , manager Ben Chapman taunts Robinson , causing him to go back to the dugout and smash his bat out of frustration . With encouragement from Rickey , Robinson then returns to the field and hits a single , steals second base and advances to third on a throwing error , and scores the winning run . When Chapman s behavior toward Robinson generates bad press for the team , the Phillies ' owner requires him to pose with Robinson for newspapers and magazine photos . Later , Robinson s teammate , Pee Wee Reese , comes to understand what kind of pressure Robinson is facing , and makes a public show of solidarity , standing with his arm around Robinson s shoulders before a hostile crowd in Cincinnati , silencing them . In a game against the St. Louis Cardinals , Enos Slaughter accidentally spikes Robinson on the back of the leg with his cleats while running the bases . Robinson s home run against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , who had earlier hit him in the head , helps clinch the National League pennant for the Dodgers , sending them to the World Series , which they would lose to the New York Yankees . A concluding postscript describes how Rickey , Robinson , and many of his teammates went on to have distinguished careers , including inductions into the Baseball Hall of Fame , besides Chapman , who was fired and forbidden to join an MLB team forever due to his racism . The notes also describe the entrance of other African Americans into the Major Leagues , beginning with the season after Robinson s debut .
