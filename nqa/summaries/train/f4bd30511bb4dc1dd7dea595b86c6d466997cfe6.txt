In October 2003 , 19-year-old Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright . Returning to his dorm , Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his LiveJournal blog and then creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students , then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness . After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard s computer network , Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation . However , Facemash s popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra . The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection , a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating . After agreeing to work on the Winklevoss twins ' concept , Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for what he calls Thefacebook , an online social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students . Saverin provides $ 1,000 in seed funding , allowing Mark to build the website , which quickly becomes popular . When they learn of Thefacebook , the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed , believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them deliberately in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website . They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers , who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook website itself . Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee , who asks them to Facebook me , a phrase which impresses both of them . As Thefacebook grows in popularity , Zuckerberg extends the network to Yale University , Columbia University and Stanford University . Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker , who presents a billion dollar vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg . He also suggests dropping the The from Thefacebook , just calling it Facebook . At Parker s suggestion , the company moves to Palo Alto , with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development . After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents , Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters . While competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard , the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Oxford , Cambridge , and the LSE and decide to sue the company for theft of intellectual property . Meanwhile , Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company s bank account in the resulting dispute . He later relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $ 500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel . However , Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34 % to 0.03 % , while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties . He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker about it , and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg for all the company s shares before being ejected from the building . As a result , Saverin s name is removed from the masthead as co-founder . Later , a cocaine possession incident involving Parker and his attempt to place the blame on Saverin finally convinces Zuckerberg to cut ties with him . Throughout the film , the narrative is intercut with scenes from depositions taken in the Winklevoss twins ' and Saverin s respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook . The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea , while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated . At the end , Marylin Delpy , a junior lawyer for the defense , informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin , since the sordid details of Facebook s founding and Zuckerberg s own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury . After everyone leaves , Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response . The epilogue states that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of $ 65 million , signed a non-disclosure agreement , and rowed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics , placing sixth ; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a co-founder ; the website has over 500 million members in 207 countries and is valued at 25 billion dollars ; and Mark Zuckerberg is the world s youngest billionaire .
