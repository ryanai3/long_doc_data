In the Antarctic , a Norwegian helicopter pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station . Upon landing , the passenger accidentally drops a thermite charge , which destroys the helicopter and kills the pilot when he tries to retrieve it . The passenger pursues the dog , firing a rifle , until he is shot dead by Garry , the station commander . The Americans send a helicopter pilot , MacReady , and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers , but they find only a charred ruin . Inside , they find a corpse with its throat and wrists slashed in the radio room . Outside , they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces , which they bring back along with some video tapes . Their biologist , Blair , performs an autopsy on the corpse , finding a normal set of human internal organs . Clark kennels the Malamute with the station s sled dogs ; it soon metamorphoses and attacks them . When he hears the commotion , MacReady pulls the fire alarm , and Childs incinerates the creature . Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms . The Norwegians ' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station s geologist , Norris , hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old . Blair becomes increasingly paranoid and withdraws , calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area , all life on Earth will be assimilated within a few years . Fuchs tells MacReady that he is worried about Blair , and according to Blair s journal , the creature s dead remains are still active on a cellular level . The camp enacts safety measures designed to reduce risk of assimilation . The creature assimilates Bennings , but Windows catches him outside before his metamorphosis is complete and MacReady burns the creature before it can escape . They discover Blair has wrecked all the transports and killed the remaining sled dogs . The team corners Blair as he is destroying the radio and locks him in an isolated tool shed . Copper recommends a blood-serum test to determine who is assimilated , but the paranoid men turn on each other when they find the blood stores have been sabotaged . MacReady takes charge and orders Fuchs to continue Blair s work , but Fuchs disappears ; MacReady , Windows , and Nauls find his burned body outside . Windows returns to warn the others while MacReady and Nauls investigate further . On the way back , Nauls cuts MacReady loose from the tow line . He assumes that MacReady has been assimilated when he finds a torn shirt with MacReady s name on it . As the team debates MacReady s fate , he breaks in and threatens to destroy the station with a bundle of dynamite if they attack him . Norris appears to suffer a heart attack after he and Nauls unsuccessfully attack MacReady from behind . When Copper attempts to revive him , Norris transforms and kills Copper . MacReady incinerates the creature and orders Windows to tie up everyone for a new test . Clark attacks MacReady , and MacReady shoots him in the head , killing him . MacReady explains his theory that every piece of the alien is an individual organism with its own survival instinct . One by one , MacReady tests everyone s blood with a heated piece of copper wire , including Copper and Clark s bodies . Everyone is still human except Palmer , whose blood flees from the hot wire . Exposed , Palmer metamorphoses and attacks Windows , forcing MacReady to burn them both . Leaving Childs on guard , the others head out to test Blair , only to find that he has tunneled out of the tool shed . They realize that Blair is assimilated and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft . Discovering that Childs is missing and the station s power generator is destroyed , MacReady speculates that the Thing now intends to hibernate until a rescue team arrives . MacReady , Garry , and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex , hoping to destroy the Thing . While setting the explosives , Garry is killed and Nauls disappears . As MacReady rushes to set the charges , Blair , now metamorphosed into a larger monster emerges from below and destroys the detonator . MacReady triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite , destroying the abomination and the base . MacReady sits nearby as the camp burns , and Childs reappears . Childs claims he was lost in the storm , pursuing Blair . They discuss their prospects of survival and distrust of each other , eventually deciding to stay put and see what happens . MacReady offers Childs a bottle and chuckles .
