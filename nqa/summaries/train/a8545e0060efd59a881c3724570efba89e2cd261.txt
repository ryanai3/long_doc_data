After being pulled through a time portal , Ash Williams lands in A.D. 1300 , where he is soon captured by Lord Arthur s men , who suspect him to be an agent for Duke Henry , with whom Arthur is at war . He is enslaved along with the captured Henry , his gun and chainsaw confiscated , and is taken to a castle . Ash is thrown in a pit where he fights off a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur s Wise Man . After demanding Henry and his men be set free ( as he knew Henry was innocent , and his persecution was simply a witch hunt ) and killing a Deadite in full view of everyone , Ash is celebrated as a hero . He also grows attracted to Sheila , the sister of one of Arthur s fallen knights . According to the Wise Man , the only way Ash can return to his time is to retrieve the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis , a book with magical powers . After bidding goodbye to Sheila , Ash starts his search for the Necronomicon . As he enters a haunted forest , an unseen force pursues Ash through the woods . Fleeing , he ducks into a windmill where he crashes into a mirror . The small reflections of Ash climb out from the shattered mirror and torment him . One of the reflections dives down Ash s throat and uses his body to become a life-sized clone of Ash and attack him , after which Ash kills and buries the clone . When he arrives at the Necronomicon s location , he finds three books instead of one . Ash eventually finds the real one and attempts to say the magic phrase that will allow him to remove the book safelyÂ â Klaatu barada nikto . However , forgetting the last word , he tries to trick the book by mumbling and coughing the missing word . He then grabs the book from the cradle , and rushes back to the castle , while the dead rise from graves all around . During Ash s panicked ride back , his evil copy rises from his grave and unites the Deadites into the Army of Darkness . Despite causing the predicament faced by the medieval soldiers , Ash initially demands to be returned to his own time . However , Sheila is captured by a Flying Deadite , and later transformed into a Deadite . Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the army of the dead . Reluctantly , the people agree to join Ash . Using scientific knowledge from textbooks in the trunk of his 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 , and enlisting the help of Duke Henry , Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash , saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry in the process . The Wise Men return him to his own time , giving him a potion to drink after reciting the magic phrase . Back in the present , Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at his job , working in housewares at a store called S-Mart . As he talks to a girl who is interested in his story , a surviving deadite , allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word of the magic phrase , attacks the customers . Ash attacks and kills it using a Winchester rifle from the store s Sporting Goods department , finally ending the deadite threat .
