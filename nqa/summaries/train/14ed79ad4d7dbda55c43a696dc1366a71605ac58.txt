The title designates time and location : an unusually hot August in a rural area outside Pawhuska , Oklahoma . Beverly Weston ( Sam Shepard ) , an alcoholic , once-noted poet , interviews and hires a young native American woman Johnna ( Misty Upham ) as a live-in cook and caregiver for his strong-willed and contentious wife Violet ( Meryl Streep ) , who is suffering from oral cancer and addiction to narcotics . Shortly after this , he disappears from the house , and Violet calls her sister and daughters for support . Her sister Mattie Fae ( Margo Martindale ) arrives with husband Charles Aiken ( Chris Cooper ) . Violet s middle daughter Ivy ( Julianne Nicholson ) is single and the only one living locally ; Barbara ( Julia Roberts ) , her oldest , who has inherited her mother s mean streak , arrives from Colorado with her husband Bill ( Ewan McGregor ) and 14-year-old daughter Jean ( Abigail Breslin ) . Barbara and Bill are separated , but they put up a united front for Violet . After five days , the sheriff arrives with the news that Beverly took his boat out on the lake and has drowned . Youngest daughter Karen ( Juliette Lewis ) arrives with the latest in a string of boyfriends , Steve Huberbrecht ( Dermot Mulroney ) , a sleazy Florida businessman whom she introduces as her fiancĂŠ . Mattie Fae and Charles s shy , awkward son Little Charles ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) misses the funeral because he overslept and is met at the bus station by his father . Charles loves his son , whereas Mattie constantly belittles him . Ivy confides to Barbara that she is in love with her cousin , Little Charles , who plans to move to New York , and she can not have children because she had a hysterectomy . She feels this is her only chance to finally marry . The family sits down to dinner after the funeral , fueled by Violet s brutal truth telling , which results in Barbara pouncing on her mother . She decides she has had enough of her mother s drug addiction and confiscates all her several kinds of pills . Later , after Violet has had a chance to sober up , she has a tender moment with her daughters and shares a story that demonstrates how cruel her own mother was when she longed for a new pair of cowgirl boots when she was in her early teens . As Little Charles sings Ivy a song he has written for her , Mattie Fae walks in and berates him . This exhausts Charles s patience with his wife s lack of love and compassion for her son , and he threatens to leave her if she keeps it up . Mattie subsequently reveals to Barbara , who unintentionally listened in , that she had a long-ago affair with Beverly , and Charles is in fact their younger half-brother and that is the true reason why Ivy and Little Charles can not be together . That evening , Steve and Jean are playfully sharing a joint of marijuana . Johnna sees this and , sensing that he intends on molesting her , goes after him with a shovel . Barbara confronts Jean and slaps her . This impels Bill to take Jean back to Colorado , leaving Barbara . Karen also leaves with Steve . Later , Ivy tries to tell her mother about her love for Little Charles . Barbara tries to deflect the admission . Violet tells Ivy Charles is actually her brother , something she knew all along . Ivy leaves and promises to never come back . In the last confrontation between Violet and Barbara , Violet admits she was contacted by Beverly from his motel the week after he had left home , but did nothing to help him until after she removed money from the couple s joint safe deposit box . By this time he had already drowned . This revelation leads Barbara to depart . Violet is left with only Johnna . Barbara is driving through the plains , stops , gets out of the car , cries then gets back in the car and follows signage showing highways and number of miles to Wichita , Salina and Denver .
