In Stockholm , Sweden , journalist Mikael Blomkvist ( Daniel Craig ) , co-owner of Millennium magazine , has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström ( Ulf Friberg ) . Lisbeth Salander ( Rooney Mara ) , a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker , compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger ( Christopher Plummer ) , who has a special task for him . In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström , Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik s grandniece , Harriet , 40 years ago . After moving to the Vanger family s compound , Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher . Salander , who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency , is appointed a new guardian , lawyer Nils Bjurman ( Yorick van Wageningen ) , after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke . Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her , not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag . At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun , rapes him with a dildo , and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach . Threatening to disclose the video recording , she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money . Blomkvist s daughter Pernilla ( Josefin Asplund ) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references . Blomkvist tells Vanger s lawyer , Dirch Frode ( Steven Berkoff ) , that he needs help with his research , and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself . Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook s content . She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967 , with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names ; many of the Vangers are known antisemites . During the investigation , Salander and Blomkvist become lovers . Henrik s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin ( Stellan Skarsgård ) , Harriet s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire , and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect . Salander s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father , Gottfried , committed the murders . Blomkvist breaks into Martin s house to look for more clues , but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him . While torturing Blomkvist , Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet . Salander arrives , subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist . While Salander tends to Blomkvist , Martin flees . Salander , on her motorcycle , pursues Martin in his SUV . He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire . Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12 . Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita ( Joely Richardson ) likely knows where she is . He and Salander monitor Anita , waiting for her to contact Harriet . When nothing happens , Blomkvist confronts her , deducing that the woman posing as Anita is Harriet herself . She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years , and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense . Her cousin Anita smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity . Finally free of her brother , she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik . As promised , Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerström , but it proves worthless . Salander hacks into Wennerström s computer and presents Blomkvist with evidence of Wennerström s crimes . Blomkvist publishes an article that ruins Wennerström , who flees the country . Salander hacks into Wennerström s bank accounts and , travelling to Switzerland in disguise , transfers two billion euros to various accounts . Wennerström is found murdered . Salander reveals to her former guardian Holger Palmgren that she is in love with Blomkvist . On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present , Salander sees him with his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger ( Robin Wright ) . Heartbroken , she discards the gift and rides away .
