In 1968 , Frank Lucas is the right-hand man of Harlem gangster Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson . When Johnson dies of a heart attack , Lucas takes control of the Harlem crime scene . After handing in almost $ 1 million that he found in a mobster s car , Newark detective Richie Roberts is ostracized in his precinct . After his exiled and addicted partner overdoses on a potent brand of heroin called Blue Magic , Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a task force that targets local suppliers . Lucas buys Blue Magic directly from producers in Thailand and smuggles it into the U.S. through returning Vietnam War servicemen . His low overhead allows him to eventually wholesale Blue Magic to most the dealers in the New York area . With this monopoly , Lucas expands his control to nightclubs , casinos , and prostitution . He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers , including Huey and Turner , as lieutenants to spread his empire . During his rise to becoming Harlem s crime boss , Lucas falls in love with Eva , a Puerto Rican beauty queen . As Lucas ' business prospers , he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention . Also , he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence . However , Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva , sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva ; Roberts attends the fight , notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters , and investigates him . Meanwhile , Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano , who threatens to destroy Lucas ' family unless he gets in on a deal , and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo , who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut . Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes , a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas ' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name . After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas ' supply , he is forced to rely on the other crime rings . Roberts ' detectives witness Frank Lucas ' cousin and driver shoot a woman and then use the threat of a long sentence to get him to wear a wire . The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas ' stock , discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen . With this evidence they obtain a warrant to follow the drugs into Newark s projects and Lucas ' heroin processing facility . In the ensuing shootout , Steve Lucas , Frank Lucas ' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas ' crime family , is killed . Meanwhile , Trupo , whose prized Shelby Mustang Lucas had destroyed , and his men break into Lucas ' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse , killing the dog . As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo , his mother dissuades him from killing a cop , warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does . Lucas is arrested after Roberts ' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers . In the police station , Lucas offers to bribe Roberts , but is rebuffed . Instead , Roberts offers Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names . In the end , three quarters of the New York DEA are arrested and convicted , and a distraught Trupo commits suicide . Roberts , having just passed the bar exam , defends Lucas as his first client . Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison , of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991 .
