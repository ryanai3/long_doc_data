Mini Drogues ( Nikki Reed ) is a clever and adventurous high school senior who is bored with her life . Mini prizes her unique experiences ( she calls them firsts ) . For excitement , and to add to her list of firsts , Mini decides to try being a call girl . Her first client , however , has a guilty conscience and ca n't carry through with the act , which disappoints Mini . Her second client is decidedly more exciting : her stepfather Martin ( Alec Baldwin ) . Martin is initially shocked when he learns of her identity ( he initially blindfolded himself during intercourse as per Mini s request ) , but soon a torrid love affair blossoms between the two . In order to be together , Mini and Martin concoct a plan to have Mini s mother Diane ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) declared insane . When their plan fails , Mini convinces Martin to murder Diane , despite his initial resistance to the idea . They attempt to make it appear that Diane committed suicide , but they soon attract the attention of a detective ( Luke Wilson ) who believes that Mini and Martin killed her . A nosy neighbor , Mike ( Jeff Goldblum ) , is sexually obsessed with Mini , and when Martin learns that Mini had gone to Mike s house and had received sexual pictures from him , he and Mike get into a fight . Mini arrives to find Martin standing over the neighbor , ready to beat him into unconsciousness , and when the police arrive they arrest Martin . Mini visits Martin in jail and admits that the sexual pictures sent were actually from her in order to get Martin to think that the neighbor sent them . She also reveals that she assumed the police would eventually believe he killed Diane ( since he was the more likely perpetrator ) . Mini , therefore , ends up getting away with murder , and inherits her mother s fortune . The film ends with Mini giving a valedictorian speech , even though she is a C student ; the school gave her straight A s out of sympathy for her mother s death . She offers advice to the graduating class about how to live a good life , that perversely alludes to her crimes without making her look too suspicious . The detective is present at the speech , clearly still suspicious of Mini , but knowing that he will probably never be able to prove that she was guilty of murdering her mother .
