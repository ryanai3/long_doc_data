A married couple Josh ( Patrick Wilson ) and Renai ( Rose Byrne ) , their sons Dalton ( Ty Simpkins ) and Foster ( Andrew Astor ) , and infant daughter Cali have recently moved into a new home . One night , Dalton is drawn to the attic when he hears creaking noises and sees the door open by itself . He falls from a ladder while investigating and sees a figure in the shadows . Hearing his terrified screams , Renai and Josh rush to his aid and declare the attic off limits to the children . The next day , Dalton falls into an inexplicable coma . After three months of treatment without result , Renai and Josh are allowed to take Dalton home . Soon after , paranormal activity begins to occur ; Renai begins hearing voices over the baby monitor when no one is in Cali s room , Foster says that Dalton sleepwalks at night , Renai sees a frightening figure of a man in Cali s room , who vanishes when Josh comes and the burglar alarm is repeatedly triggered for no reason with the front door open . After Renai finds a bloody hand print on Dalton s bed , she questions Josh about the house , but he ignores her . That night , Renai is attacked by the figure from Cali s room , and the Lamberts decide to abandon the house and move elsewhere . In the new house , Renai sees the ghost of a dancing boy who leads her to Dalton s room . Josh s mother , Lorraine ( Barbara Hershey ) , visits them one day , and says she had a dream in which a figure in Dalton s room replies Dalton when she asks what it wants ; at the same time , she sees a monstrous red-faced demon standing behind Josh and screams , while Dalton s room is ransacked and Dalton himself is found lying on the floor . Lorraine calls demonologists Elise Reiner ( Lin Shaye ) , Specs ( Leigh Whannell ) , and Tucker ( Angus Sampson ) . Upon entering , Elise senses a presence in the house and upon entering Dalton s room , she sees something on the ceiling ; to which Specs draws the demonic , red-faced figure Lorraine saw . Elise explains that Dalton is not in a coma ; he was born with the ability to travel mentally to the astral plane . He has traveled too far and become lost in a purgatory realm called The Further , a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead . Without his mental presence , Dalton s body appears comatose and spirits can use it to enter the physical world . Josh is skeptical until he realizes that all of Dalton s drawings are of the demonic entity drawn by Specs . Elise performs a seance to communicate with Dalton , but they contact the demon who threatens them before using Dalton s body to attack them until it is stopped by Elise . She reveals that her acquaintance with Lorraine is decades old , because she previously performed the same service on Josh when he was eight years old ( he was terrorized by the parasitic spirit of an old woman ) . Josh also possesses the ability to astral project , and Dalton inherited this trait from him . Elise tells Josh that the only way to rescue Dalton is to go into the Further . Elise puts Josh in a trance and he is able to project himself to their previous house . He goes to the attic and finds a red door , but is attacked by the mysterious figure that attacked Renai . After defeating him , Josh enters the Demon s lair , where Josh finds Dalton chained to the floor . After a tearful reunion , Josh frees him , but they are caught by the demon . Josh tries to fight it , but they are forced to flee with the demon in pursuit . Returning through the red door , Josh confronts the old woman that haunted him as a child . The old woman dissolves into darkness after Josh shouts at it to leave him alone . When Josh and Dalton return to their bodies they wake up in their new home and the spirits seem to disappear . As they celebrate the apparent end of their ordeal , Elise starts packing her equipment with Josh , when she senses that something is wrong ( she notices Josh s hands look old and dirty , similar to the old woman s ) , and proceeds to take a photo of Josh . Josh goes into a violent rage , as he does n't like to have his picture taken and strangles Elise to death . Renai is horrified when she discovers Elise s dead body and searches for Josh to inform him of her sudden death . Renai picks up the camera and sees that the image Elise took of Josh is the old woman that haunted him as a child , implying that Josh has been possessed . Josh suddenly puts his hand on her shoulder , and she turns around and gasps .
