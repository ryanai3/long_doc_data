In 1967 , during the Vietnam War , Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz ( Marlon Brando ) has become insane and now commands his own Montagnard troops , inside neutral Cambodia , as a demi-god . Colonel Lucas ( Harrison Ford ) and General Corman ( G.D. Spradlin ) , who are growing increasingly concerned with Kurtz s renegade operations , assign U.S. Army Captain and Studies and Observations Group veteran Benjamin L. Willard ( Martin Sheen ) to terminate the Colonel s command with extreme prejudice . Willard , while ambivalent about the mission , joins a Navy PBR ( for Patrol boat , riverine ) commanded by Chief ( Albert Hall ) and crewmen Lance ( Sam Bottoms ) , Chef ( Frederic Forrest ) and ( Mr. ) Clean ( Laurence Fishburne ) to head upriver . They rendezvous with surfing enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore ( Robert Duvall ) , a commander of a cavalry squadron , to discuss going up the Nung River . Kilgore initially scoffs at them , but befriends Lance when he discovers he is an expert surfer and agrees to escort them through the Viet Cong-held coastal mouth of the river where surfing conditions are particularly good . At dawn the helicopter raid commences . Amid the attack , Kilgore calls in a napalm sortie on the local cadres and the rivermouth is taken . Willard gathers his men to the PBR , which has been transported via helicopter , and begins the journey up river . Tension arises between Chief and Willard as Willard believes himself to be in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes other objectives over Willard s secret mission . Slowly making their way upriver , Willard reveals part of his mission to the Chief to assuage the Chief s concerns about why his mission should take precedence . As night falls , the PBR reaches the chaotic last US outpost on the NĂšng River , the Do Long Bridge . Willard and Lance enter the base seeking information on what is upriver . Unable to find anyone in command of the base , Willard orders the Chief to continue upriver as an unseen enemy launches a strike on the bridge . The next day , Willard learns from a dispatch that another Studies and Observation Group ( SOG ) operative , Captain Colby ( Scott Glenn ) , who was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard s , had joined Kurtz . ( A few days before Willard received this dispatch , Chief had told him that about six months prior to Willard s mission Chief had taken another man north of the Do Long Bridge . Chief had heard this man shot himself in the head . ) Meanwhile , as the rest of the crew read letters from home , Lance pops open a purple smoke grenade for fun . It attracts the attention of an unseen enemy in the trees , and Mr. Clean is killed during the firefight . Further up the river , they are attacked by the natives once moreâone enemy throws a spear that impales Chief , and in his final moments , he attempts to kill Willard by pulling him down onto the spear s point . Willard retaliates by suffocating him . While Lance buries Chief s body in the river , Willard finally reveals his mission to Chefâdespite Chef s initial outrage at the fact that Willard is going to kill one of our own guys , he rejects Willard s offer to let the two of them head back downriver while Willard goes on alone , and insists that they complete the mission together . The PBR arrives at Kurtz s outpost , and the surviving crew members are met by an American freelance photojournalist ( Dennis Hopper ) , who manically praises Kurtz s genius . As they wander through the compound they come across Colby , who stands nearly catatonic , along with other US servicemen now serving in Kurtz s renegade army . After returning to the PBR , Willard later takes Lance with him , leaving Chef behind with orders to call in an airstrike on Kurtz s compound if they do not return . In the camp , Willard is subdued , bound and brought before Kurtz in a darkened temple . Tortured and imprisoned , Willard screams as Kurtz drops Chef s severed head into his lap . After several days , Willard is released and given the freedom of the compound . Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war , humanity and civilization while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of the Viet Cong . Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him in the event of his death . That night , as the Montagnards ceremonially slaughter a water buffalo , Willard stealthily enters Kurtz s chamber as Kurtz is making a tape recording and attacks him with a machete . Lying mortally wounded on the ground , Kurtz , with his dying breath , whispers ... The horror ... the horror ... . All in the compound now sense something amiss in Kurtz s quarters ; seeing Willard departing the room , dropping a bloody machete and carrying a collection of Kurtz s writings , they drop their own weapons and bow down , allowing Willard to take Lance by the hand and lead him to the boat . The two of them motor away , as Kurtz s final words echo eerily for the audience , as their world fades to black .
