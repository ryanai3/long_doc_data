Quiet teenager Marc Hall ( Israel Broussard ) arrives as a new student at Indian Hills High School in Agoura Hills , California . He is befriended by fame-obsessed Rebecca Ahn ( Katie Chang ) . While at a party at Rebecca s house , the pair check unlocked vehicles on the street , taking valuables such as cash and credit cards . When Marc mentions that one of his wealthy acquaintances is out of town , Rebecca persuades him to join her in breaking into to his house . Rebecca steals a handbag , mentioning that her idol , Lindsay Lohan , has the same one . She also steals cash and the keys to a Porsche , which the pair use to flee the scene . With the cash , the two go on a shopping spree , affording themselves the luxury lifestyle they admire in magazines . Marc visits a nightclub with Rebecca and her friends Nicki ( Emma Watson ) , Nicki s adopted sister Sam ( Taissa Farmiga ) , and Chloe ( Claire Julien ) , where they rub shoulders with celebrities such as Kirsten Dunst and Paris Hilton . While researching Hilton on the Internet , Marc and Rebecca realize that she will be out of town . The pair go to her house , and finding the key under the doormat , they go through Hilton s belongings , taking some jewelry . Rebecca then flaunts a stolen bracelet to Nicki , Sam , and Chloe at a party . At Nicki s request , Rebecca and Marc take her , Sam and Chloe back to Hilton s house . The group marvels at the excess of Hilton s lifestyle , and steals shoes , bags , dresses , cash , and jewelry . Marc and Rebecca return to rob Hilton s house on a third occasion . The pair also decides to rob the home of Audrina Patridge , once again using the Internet to determine when she will not be home . The entire group uses the same method to burgle the home of Megan Fox , with Nicki s younger sister Emily ( Georgia Rock ) squeezing through a pet door to gain access to the home . The group enters the home of Orlando Bloom and his girlfriend , Miranda Kerr . The girls proceed to steal similar items , while Marc finds a case filled with seven of Bloom s Rolex watches along with a roll of cash . Chloe then helps Marc sell the watches to her friend , a night club manager named Ricky ( Gavin Rossdale ) . The group returns once again to Hilton s house , with Sam s boyfriend Rob , who also steals from the home . A news report releases captured CCTV footage from the robbery at Patridge s home . This concerns Marc , but Rebecca is undeterred and instigates a burglary at the home of Rachel Bilson . Word spreads amongst the group s social circles , and the girls boast of their accomplishments at parties , also posting photographs of the stolen items on social media sites . The group ultimately breaks into Lohan s house and robs it . Shortly after , Rebecca moves to Las Vegas with her father due to troubles at home , leaving some of her stolen items with Marc , who inadvertently helps Rebecca transfer stolen items across state lines . News reports of the Hollywood Hills burglaries intensify , with the media labeling the group The Bling Ring . CCTV from several robberies in addition to the evidence on social media allows authorities to identify the group . Police arrest Marc , Nicki , Chloe , Rebecca , Rob , and Ricky , but Sam is not identified in the footage and avoids arrest . Marc cooperates with the police , informing them on the details of the burglaries , much to the chagrin of Rebecca , who has been identified as the ringleader . A Vanity Fair journalist interviews Marc , who is remorseful , and Nicki , who vehemently suggests the others were at fault , and that she was simply involved with the wrong people . Rebecca also denies being at fault and tries to pass the blame for all of this and Marc and her other friends . The group is ultimately prosecuted , receiving varying amounts of jail time and is ordered to collectively pay millions of dollars in restitution for the stolen items . The group serves its jail time , and Marc and Rebecca each go into seclusion from the press . They never see or speak to each other again , and both of them steadfastly blame each other for the robberies . In the final scene , set a few months later , Nicki is on a talk show talking about her time in jail , and reveals that her cell was next to Lohan s . After digressing , she turns to the audience ( and the viewers ) as she finds a way to enhance her newfound notoriety , telling them to visit her now-popular website detailing her life after The Bling Ring .
