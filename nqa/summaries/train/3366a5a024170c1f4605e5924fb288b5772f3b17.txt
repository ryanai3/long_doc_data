At an early age he became interested in martial arts , and moved to Japan to study . In 1969 , Nico was recruited into the CIA by Special Agent Nelson Fox and was involved in covert operations on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border during the Vietnam War in 1973 . There , he became disgusted with Kurt Zagon , who tortured prisoners . A stand-off occurred when Nico tried to stop a torture session , and he left the CIA . Nico returned to Chicago , joined the CPD , and got married . Nico and his new partner Detective Delores Jacks Jackson ( Pam Grier ) , are now investigating a drug ring , and after busting two of the dealers , including Salvadorian drug dealer Tony Salvano , Nico finds C4 explosives . Shortly afterward , the men that Nico and Jacks arrested are released at the request of Federal officials , and Nico is asked to stand down . Later , the priest of Nicoâs parish is killed in an explosion during Mass . Fox calls Nico and tells him to move his family to a safer location , saying that Nico is in danger . Under pressure from the Feds , Nico is asked to turn in his badge . Nico eventually finds that the dealers he busted are linked to Zagon , who is still with the CIA , and who is accused of human rights violations by a Central American priest who was being sheltered by Nico s priest . While Zagon is torturing the priest , Nico bursts in and a gun battle ensues . Detective Lukich ( Ron Dean ) and Jacks are wounded during the shoot-out , and Nico has to flee .

Harrison promises justice for what they did and Nico says he is now willing to testify on his experiences with Zagon and covert operations in the CIA .
