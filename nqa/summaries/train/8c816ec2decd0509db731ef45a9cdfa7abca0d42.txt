As a storm approaches a southern Louisiana bayou community called the Bathtub ( a community cut off from the rest of the world by a levee ) , six-year-old Hushpuppy and her ailing , hot-tempered father Wink are optimistic about their life and their future . The children in school are being taught by Miss Bathsheba about nature and the release of prehistoric creatures called Aurochs from the melting ice caps . At home , Hushpuppy fends for herself while her father is missing . When he returns , he is wearing a hospital gown and bracelet . They argue , and when Hushpuppy returns to her house , she deliberately sets it on fire . A chase ensues between the two , and she ends up getting slapped by Wink . When she retaliates by punching him in the chest , Wink collapses . Hushpuppy , realizing the damage she has caused , runs for help only to find her father missing when she returns . Meanwhile , in the Arctic , the frozen Aurochs in an ice shelf start drifting into the ocean . Many of the Bathtub residents start fleeing due to the threat of an approaching storm . Wink reappears , staggering along the side of the road ; he finds Hushpuppy and takes her home to start barricading before the storm hits . In an effort to make his daughter feel better , Wink attempts to scare off the storm by firing a rifle at the clouds . The next day , the two tour the devastation and connect with surviving residents . The Bathtub residents celebrate and make plans to rebuild their community , but the environment is damaged because of the salt water brought in by the storm surge to fresh waters . Wink hatches a plan to drain the water away by destroying the levee . He and a small group of friends plant dynamite and blow a hole in the wall using an alligator gar , and the water recedes . Authorities arrive and enforce a mandatory evacuation order , removing the residents of the Bathtub to an emergency shelter . Wink receives surgery , but it is too late to restore his health . At the first opportunity , the evacuees leave and escape back to their homes . Aware of her fatherâs condition , Hushpuppy searches for her absent mother . She and her friends swim to a boat , which takes them to a floating bar , known as the Elysian Fields . Hushpuppy meets a cook who may be her mother , though the woman does n't recognize her . The cook says that the girl can stay with her if she wants , but Hushpuppy says that she s got to go home . Hushpuppy and her friends return home where she confronts the Aurochs . As the Aurochs leave , Hushpuppy returns home . She says her last goodbyes to the dying Wink , listening to his last heartbeat . She sets his funeral pyre ablaze , standing together with the remaining residents of the Bathtub .
