Emily Jenkins ( RenĂŠe Zellweger ) is a social worker living in Oregon , who is assigned to investigate the family of ten-year-old Lillith Sullivan ( Jodelle Ferland ) , as her grades have declined and an emotional rift with her parents has emerged . Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith . Emily s fears are confirmed when Lillith s parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home . Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron ( Ian McShane ) . Lillith is originally sent to a children s home , but she begs Emily to look after her instead . With the agreement of the board , Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable foster family comes along . In the meantime , Lillith s parents , Edward and Margaret ( Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry O'Malley ) are placed in a mental institution . Not too long after Lillith moves in , strange things begin to happen around Emily . Two weeks later , another of Emily s cases , a boy named Diego ( Alexander Conti ) , suddenly murders his parents , and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime . As she is suspected of involvement in the incident , Lillith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily s best friend , Douglas J. Ames ( Bradley Cooper ) . During the session , however , Lillith turns the evaluation around , asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him . That night after receiving a strange phone call , Douglas is panicked by a mass of hornets coming out of his body in hysteria and kills himself in his bathroom . Emily gradually becomes fearful of Lillith , so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lillith s parents . They tell her that , far from being truly human , Lillith is actually a demon like-Succubus who feeds on emotion , and that they had tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves . Lillith s father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lillith is to get her to sleep . Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum , Lillith s mother hallucinates being on fire , and her father is stabbed in the eye after attacking a fellow inmate through whom the voice of Lillith spoke . Barron initially thinks Emily should seek psychiatric help , but is later convinced when he receives a strange phone call in his home from Lillith . He arms himself to help Emily . However , he fatally shoots himself in the head with his shotgun , as Lilith makes him imagine he is being attacked by dogs . After realizing that her closest colleagues have been eliminated , and that the rest of her cases will be next , Emily serves Lillith tea spiked with sedative . While Lillith is asleep , Emily sets fire to her house , hoping to get rid of her . However , the girl apparently escapes unharmed ( from this point on , the audience may wonder whether Lilith is really present or Emily is hallucinating her presence ) . A police officer offers to escort Emily and Lillith to a temporary place to sleep . As Emily is following the police cars , she suddenly takes a different route and drives her car at a high speed , hoping to bring fear to Lillith . Instead , Lillith forces Emily to relive her childhood memory of her mother driving fast in a rainstorm . Emily fights through the memory , telling herself that it is not real . The image fades , and Lillith appears scared by the fact that Emily was able to fight through her illusion . Emily drives the car off a pier . As the car sinks , Emily struggles to lock Lillith ( now in her demonic true form ) in the trunk . Emily then attempts to swim to the surface . The demon grabs Emily s foot to stop her from swimming away but Emily struggles and eventually breaks free , as a trapped Lillith sinks to the bottom . Emily climbs out of the water and sits on the pier .
