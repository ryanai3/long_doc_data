Physicist Reed Richards is convinced evolution was triggered millions of years ago on Earth by clouds of cosmic energy in space , and has calculated that one of these clouds is soon going to pass near Earth . Together with his friend , astronaut Ben Grimm , Reed convinces Victor Von Doom , his former classmate at MIT and now CEO of Von Doom Industries , to allow him access to his privately owned space station to test the effects of a biological sample of exposure to the cloud . Doom agrees in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings . Reed brings aboard his ex-girlfriend and Von Doom s chief genetics researcher Sue Storm and her ex-astronaut younger brother Johnny Storm . The quintet travels to outer space to observe the cosmic energy clouds , but Reed miscalculates and the clouds materialize ahead of schedule . Reed and the Storms leave the shielded station to rescue Ben , who had gone on a spacewalk to place the samples . Ben receives full exposure in outer space , while the others receive a more limited dose within the station . Back home they soon develop superpowers : Reed can stretch his body like rubber , Susan can become invisible and generate force shields , Johnny Storm can engulf himself in fire and fly unaided , and Ben becomes a rock-like creature with superhuman strength and durability . Meanwhile , Von Doom faces a backlash from his stockholders because of the publicity from the space mission , and has a scar on his face that came from an exploding control console on the station . Ben s fiancee Debbie can not handle his new appearance and leaves him . Ben goes to brood on the Brooklyn Bridge and accidentally causes a traffic pileup while preventing a man from committing suicide . Ben , Reed and the Storms use their various abilities to contain the damage and prevent harm . The media dubs them the Fantastic Four . They move into Reed s lab in the Baxter Building to study their abilities and seek a way to return Grimm to normal . Von Doom , himself mutating , offers his support but blames Reed for the failure of the spaceflight , which has lost him his company . Reed tells the group he will construct a machine to recreate the storm and reverse its effects on them , but warns it could possibly accelerate them instead . Meanwhile , Von Doom s arm has become organic metal , giving him superhuman strength allowing him to produce bolts of electricity , and he begins plotting revenge . He drives a wedge between Ben and Reed , who has rekindled his relationship with Susan Storm . Using the machine , Von Doom restores Ben to human form , while accelerating Von Doom s condition , causing much of his body to turn to metal . Von Doom knocks the human Grimm unconscious and captures Reed . Now calling himself Doctor Doom , he puts on a metallic mask and a cloak to hide his disfigurement , Doom then tortures Reed and fires a heatseeking missile at the Baxter Building in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Johnny . Sue confronts Doom but is outmatched . Ben arrives to assist her , transformed into the Thing again by reusing the machine ( speaking his signature line , It s clobberin ' time ! which used in Johnny s action figure ) . The battle then gets spilled into the streets and The Storms combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense heat , while Ben and Reed douse him with cold water , inducing thermal shock and freezing Doom in the place , defeating him and preventing the destruction of the city . In an epilogue , Grimm informs Reed that he has accepted his condition with the help of Alicia Masters , a blind artist for whom he has developed feelings , and the team embraces its role as superheroes . Reed proposes marriage to Sue , who accepts . Meanwhile , Doom s statue-like remains are being transported back to his homeland of Latveria when the dock master s electronic manifest briefly undergoes electromagnetic interference , suggesting that Doom is still alive .
