In 1969 Pasadena , California , a couple seeks the aid of the medium Shaun San Dena ( Flor de Maria Chahua ) saying their son ( Shiloh Selassie ) has been hearing evil spirits ' voices after stealing a silver necklace from gypsies . San Dena aids the family by carrying out a seance , but they are attacked by an unseen force that pulls the boy into Hell . The medium says she will encounter the force again one day . In present-day Los Angeles , bank loan officer Christine Brown hopes to be promoted to assistant manager over her co-worker Stu Rubin . Her boss , Jim Jacks , advises her to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions to get a promotion . Christine is visited by an elderly gypsy woman , Sylvia Ganush , who asks for an extension on her mortgage payment . Though empathetic with the old woman s crisis , Christine denies Ganush an extension to prove herself to her boss . Ganush begs Christine not to repossess her house and kneels in front of her . Christine gets scared of the woman s bizarre pleading as she is helping her to stand up and calls security , who take Ganush away while Ganush blames Christine for shaming her and vows to take revenge . Jim compliments Christine on how she handled the situation . When Christine goes to the bank parking garage to drive home , Ganush attacks Christine in her car , rips a button off Christine s coat and uses it to place a curse on Christine . Later , Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton meet the fortune teller , Rham Jas who tells Christine that she is being haunted by an evil spirit . At home , Christine is attacked by the spirit and has nightmares about Ganush . At work the next day , Christine snaps at Stu and has a projectile nose bleed that soaks her boss in blood . She runs away and Stu secretly takes a file off Christine s desk . Christine goes to talk to Ganush but learns that she died the previous night after visiting her house . Christine returns to Rham Jas , who explains that as long as Christine is the owner of an accursed object , she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the Lamia ( loosely based on the Greek child-eating demon ) that will torment her for three days before taking her to Hell for eternity . He suggests a sacrifice to appease the demon . Desperate to stop the attacks , Christine reluctantly sacrifices her pet kitten . At a dinner party with Clay and his parents , she is again tormented by the Lamia , but this time through the use of illusions , which frightens the Daltons . Christine returns to Rham Jas who says that Shaun San Dena will risk her life to stop the demon for a fee of $ 10,000 . San Dena prepares a seance to trap the Lamia s spirit in a goat and kill it , and then allows the Lamia to inhabit her body . Rham Jas tries to persuade it not to steal Christine s soul , but it vows never to stop until Christine dies . Christine then places San Dena s hand on the goat , causing the spirit to enter its body . San Dena s assistant , Milos , attempts to kill the goat , but is bitten by the goat and becomes possessed , attacking the members of the seance . San Dena banishes the Lamia from the seance , but dies in the process . Christine thinks the medium has overcome the Lamia , but Rham Jas explains that she only managed to drive the spirit away until the next day . Then he seals the cursed button in an envelope and tells Christine that she can get rid of the curse by giving the button to someone as a gift , thereby passing the curse on to that person . Christine decides to give the envelope to Stu in revenge for his stealing her work , but changes her mind after seeing how pathetic , tearful and panicky Stu is when he meets her . With guidance from Rham Jas , Christine learns that she can give it to Ganush even though she is dead . Christine digs up Ganush s grave and jams the envelope in her mouth just in time before dawn . Christine returns home and prepares to meet Clay at Los Angeles Union Station for a weekend trip to Santa Barbara . She gets a message from her boss telling her that she landed her dream position after Stu confessed to stealing her work and was fired . At the station , Christine also buys a coat that she has been wanting as a sign of a new beginning . Clay , planning to propose , reveals to Christine that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car . Christine then realizes she mixed up her envelope with another that she gave to Clay when she accidentally dropped it . Horrified , Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks . As a train barrels towards her , fiery hands suddenly emerge from the tracks and drag Christine into the neverending flames of Hell , as a horrified Clay watches from the platform above with the cursed button still in his hands .
