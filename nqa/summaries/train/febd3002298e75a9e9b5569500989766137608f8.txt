Larry Crowne ( Tom Hanks ) , a middle-aged Navy veteran , is fired from his job at a big-box store due to a lack of college education , despite his seniority and exemplary work . Larry , who is divorced and lives alone , can not find a job and could lose his house . Larry s neighbor , Lamar ( Cedric the Entertainer ) , advises him to enroll in the local community college and get an education . Subsisting on unemployment benefits and unable to afford to drive his SUV , Larry buys a scooter from Lamar . At the college , he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts , also-rans , and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselves . Two of the classes he takes are speech , taught by Mercedes Tainot ( Julia Roberts ) and economics , taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani ( George Takei ) . While he initially struggles in speech class , he does very well in economics . Mercedes drinks at home after school because she is unhappily married to Dean ( Bryan Cranston ) , a former professor turned writer turned blogger . In reality , Dean spends his days looking at internet porn . Larry s economics classmate Talia ( Gugu Mbatha-Raw ) invites him to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo ( Wilmer Valderrama ) . She also updates Larry s home decor , hair style , and wardrobe . Larry s friend Frank ( Ian Gomez ) , who runs the diner , offers him a job to help make ends meet , as Larry had been a Navy cook . After a night with Dean goes horribly wrong , Mercedes is left alone at a bus stop , where Larry and his scooter gang notice her . Larry offers her a ride home , which Mercedes reluctantly accepts . On their way home they witness Dean getting arrested for drunk driving . At her front door , they kiss . She wants to have sex as well , but Larry declines , not wanting to take advantage of her inebriated state . When Dean arrives home the following morning he finds all of his possessions on the front lawn . Realizing there is no way he will not lose his house , Larry uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to begin a strategic foreclosure . Mercedes , meanwhile , warns Larry not to disclose the events of the previous night , and remains under the false impression that he is romantically involved with the much-younger Talia . It disappoints Larry , who had been excited about Mercedes ' interest in him . He goes back to concentrating on his studies and his new job instead . Mercedes runs into Talia , who is telling Frances , her English teacher ( Pam Grier ) , that she will be dropping out of college to start a thrift store . Mercedes finds out that Talia and Larry are just friends . Later , Frances comes over to Mercedes ' apartment to provide emotional support due to her divorcing Dean . Finals now come , and Larry is scheduled last . His speech is about his travels around the world while in the Navy . Larry is given a big round of applause by his classmates and an A-plus grade from Mercedes , who is now happier in her life , and has rediscovered her passion for teaching . A short while later , Mercedes and Frances show up at Larry s diner . She lets him know that he was an excellent student , to which he replies that she was an excellent teacher . When the next term begins , some of the students from Mercedes ' speech course register for her Shakespeare class , but Larry is not with them . He is seen taking Dr. Matsutani s second-term Economics class . Mercedes walks to her office and sees a note from Larry on the door , which is an invitation for dinner , with the address to his new apartment . She drives there and they kiss .
