Thirty years after a nuclear apocalypse , Eli ( Denzel Washington ) travels on foot toward the west coast of the former United States . Along the way he demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills , hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of desert bandits who try to ambush him . Searching for water , he arrives in a ramshackle town rebuilt and overseen by Carnegie ( Gary Oldman ) . Carnegie dreams of building more towns and of controlling the people by using the power of a certain book . His henchmen scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it , but to no avail . In town he barters with a store owner , the Engineer ( Tom Waits ) , to recharge the battery of his portable music player . While waiting , he goes across the street to the town bar , where a gang of bikers attack , but he quickly kills them all . Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself , Carnegie asks Eli to stay , making it clear that the offer is non-negotiable . After Carnegie s blind mistress Claudia ( Jennifer Beals ) gives Eli some food and water , Carnegie orders Claudia s daughter Solara ( Mila Kunis ) to seduce Eli , but he turns her down . While killing time , she finds his book . Unperturbed , Eli offers to share his food with her , and before they eat , he says grace . The following day , Solara repeats the prayer , but Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara s words relate to the book he has been seeking . He soon forces Solara to tell him if Eli was reading a book , and realizes Eli s book is the one he wantsâa Bible . Eli sneaks out of his room and Carnegie has his henchmen shoot at Eli , but the bullets seemingly just graze him , as if he is being protected . Eli shoots most of Carnegie s men and hits Carnegie in the leg with a shotgun blast . Solara , having left the town , leads Eli to a cave which is the town s water supply , hoping she can accompany him on his travels . Eli traps her inside and continues on alone . Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her , but Eli reappears and kills them . As they continue on , Eli explains his mission to Solara . According to Eli , his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible , as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war thirty years ago . He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head , which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe . The voice assured him that he would be protected and guided on his journey . Eventually , Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house . They fall into a trap , but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents , George ( Michael Gambon ) and Martha ( Frances de la Tour ) , who invite them in for tea . When Eli realizes that the couple are cannibals , they attempt to leave just as Carnegie and his henchmen arrive . In the ensuing shootout , George , Martha and many of Carnegie s men are killed . Eli and Solara are captured . When Carnegie threatens to kill Solara , Eli surrenders the Bible , but Carnegie shoots him , and leaves him for dead . Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli . Rather than chase her , Carnegie returns to the town , since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel . Solara finds Eli , and they drive until they reach the Golden Gate Bridge , and then row to Alcatraz Island , where they find a group intent on preserving what they can of literature and music . Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the King James Version of the Bible . Once inside , Eli , revealed to be blind , begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi ( Malcolm McDowell ) , the leader of the group . Meanwhile , back in the town , the Engineer opens the locked Bible where Carnegie discovers , to his dismay , that it is in Braille , and orders Claudia to read it to him . She pretends that she can not remember how to read braille , telling Carnegie his leg wound has become infected and his men have begun to run amok . At the sanctuary , Eli has died , but not before he finished reciting the entire book . The printing press at Alcatraz begins producing copies of the Bible , and Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the Torah and Tanakh on one side and the Quran on the other . Solara , though offered sanctuary , chooses to return home , taking with her Eli s sword and other possessions .
