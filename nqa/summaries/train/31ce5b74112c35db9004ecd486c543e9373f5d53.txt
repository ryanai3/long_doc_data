Will Rodman , a scientist at the San Francisco biotech company Gen-Sys , is testing the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer s disease . ALZ-112 is given to a chimp named Bright Eyes , greatly increasing her intelligence . However , during Will s presentation for the drug , Bright Eyes is forced from her cage , goes on a rampage , and is killed . Will s boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and orders the chimps euthanized . However , Will s assistant Robert Franklin discovers that Bright Eyes had recently given birth to an infant chimp . Will agrees to take in the chimp , who is named Caesar . Will learns that Caesar has inherited his mother s intelligence and decides to raise him . Three years later , Will introduces Caesar to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument . Meanwhile , Will treats his dementia-suffering father Charles with ALZ-112 , which seems to restore his cognitive ability . When Caesar reaches adolescence and sees a dog on a leash like his own , he questions his identity and learns of his origins from Will . Meanwhile , Charles s condition returns as his Alzheimer s becomes resistant to ALZ-112 . Caesar injures a neighbor , Douglas Hunsiker , while defending a confused Charles . As a result , he is placed in a primate shelter where he is treated cruelly by the other chimps and the chief guard , Dodge Landon . Caesar learns how to unlock his cage , gaining free access to the common area . With the assistance of a gorilla named Buck , he confronts the sanctuary s alpha chimp named Rocket and claims that position . Meanwhile , Jacobs clears development of a more powerful , gaseous version of the drug â ALZ-113 â when Will tells him it can not only heal brain diseases but also improve intelligence . Will takes the drug home to try to save his father , but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight . After attempting to test the drug on a scarred bonobo test subject named Koba , Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill . Attempting to warn Will at his home , he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead . Will attempts to reclaim Caesar , but the chimp refuses to go home with him . Instead , he escapes from the facility and returns to Will s house , where he takes canisters of the ALZ-113 . Upon returning , Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the intelligence of the other apes . When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage , Caesar shocks him by speaking for the first time , yelling No ! Caesar then electrocutes the cattle prod-wielding Dodge by spraying him with water , unintentionally killing him . The apes flee the facility , release the remaining chimps from Gen-Sys , and free more apes from the San Francisco Zoo . A battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the redwood forest . Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping onto the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding . The helicopter crashes onto the bridge , trapping Jacobs in the wreckage . Jacobs is then killed by Koba . As the apes find their way into the forest , Will arrives and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down , and begs him to return home . In response , Caesar hugs him and says that , Caesar is home . Will , realizing that this is indeed their last goodbye , respects Caesar s wishes . In a mid-credits scene , an infected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot , arriving at San Francisco International Airport for his flight to Paris . His nose begins to drip blood onto the floor . A graphic traces the spread of the humanity-ravaging virus around the globe via international flight routes .
