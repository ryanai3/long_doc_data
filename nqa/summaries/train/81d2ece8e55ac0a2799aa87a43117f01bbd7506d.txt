Since the original run , Shaffer has extensively revised his play , including changes to plot details ; the following is common to all revisions . At the opening of the tale , Salieri is an old man , having long outlived his fame . Speaking directly to the audience , he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart , and promises to explain himself . The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century , at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person , but has heard of him and his music . He adores Mozart s compositions , and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person , during a salon at which some of Mozart s compositions will be played . When he finally does catch sight of Mozart , however , he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions : When Salieri first meets him , Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees , engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber . Salieri can not reconcile Mozart s boorish behaviour with the genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him . Indeed , Salieri , who has been a devout Catholic all his life , can not believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift . Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of getting back at his Creator . Throughout much of the rest of the play , Salieri masquerades as Mozart s ally to his face while doing his utmost to destroy his reputation and any success his compositions may have . On more than one occasion it is only the direct intervention of the Emperor himself that allows Mozart to continue ( interventions which Salieri opposes , and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened ) . Salieri also humiliates Mozart s wife when she comes to Salieri for aid , and smears Mozart s character with the Emperor and the court . A major theme in Amadeus is Mozart s repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic public with increasingly brilliant compositions , which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy s own inability to appreciate Mozart s genius . The play ends with Salieri attempting suicide in a last attempt to be remembered , leaving a confession of having murdered Mozart with arsenic . He survives , however , and his confession is met with disbelief , leaving him to wallow once again in mediocrity .
