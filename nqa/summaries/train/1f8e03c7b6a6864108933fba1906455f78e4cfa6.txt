In 1944 , with the help of Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin , the Nazis build a dimensional portal off the coast of Scotland and intend to free the Ogdru Jahad—monstrous entities imprisoned in deep space—to aid them in defeating the Allies . Rasputin opens the portal with the aid of his disciples , Ilsa von Haupstein and Obersturmbannführer Karl Ruprecht Kroenen , member of the Thule Society and Adolf Hitler s top assassin . An Allied team is sent to destroy the portal , guided by a young Trevor Broom , who is well-versed in the occult . The German team is killed and the portal is destroyed—in the process absorbing Rasputin—while Haupstein and Kroenen escape . The Allied team discovers that an infant demon with a right hand of stone came through the portal ; they dub him Hellboy and Bruttenholm adopts him . Sixty years later , FBI agent John Myers is transferred to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense ( BPRD ) at the request of Broom and he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic , amphibious humanoid named Abe Sapien . He learns that a third BPRD member , Liz Sherman , has recently checked into a mental hospital to protect others from her volatile pyrokinetic abilities . Despite regular visits and coaxing from Hellboy , she is determined not to return . Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin in the mountains of Moldova and the three unleash a hellhound known as Sammael . Rasputin imbues Sammael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence , causing two of the creature s eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies . Rasputin visits Liz as she sleeps , activating her powers and almost destroying the hospital . Myers convinces her to return to the Bureau .
