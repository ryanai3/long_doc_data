In 1963 Texas , convicts Robert Butch Haynes ( Kevin Costner ) and Jerry Pugh ( Keith Szarabajka ) escape from the state penitentiary in Huntsville . Fleeing , the pair stumble into a house where eight-year-old Phillip Perry ( T.J. Lowther ) lives with his devout Jehovah s Witness mother and two sisters . Needing a hostage to aid their escape , Butch grabs the boy , who meekly accompanies them . The trio s journey starts off on an unpleasant note as Butch shoots Jerry , following the latter s attempt to molest the child . With his partner out of the way , the convict and his young victim take to the Texas highway in a bid to flee from the pursuing police . Meanwhile , Texas Ranger Red Garnett ( Clint Eastwood ) , riding in the Governor s airstream trailer , is in pursuit . With criminologist Sally Gerber ( Laura Dern ) and trigger-happy FBI sharpshooter Bobby Lee ( Bradley Whitford ) in tow , Red is determined to recover the criminal and the hostage before they cross the Texas border . Also , Red reveals to Sally that he has a personal interest in apprehending Butch alive . Even though Butch does n't realize it , Red has a history with him . When Butch was a teenager , he stole a car , and Red was the arresting officer . Due to his age and it being a first offense , Butch was supposed to get a lenient sentence . Red feared doing so would not teach him anything and would only encourage him to begin a life of crime . He thought that if Butch got a harsher sentence , it would scare him straight , so he bribed the judge to make it happen . Years later , Red has come to realize that the harsher sentence only encouraged the very life of crime he feared would happen . Now , Red is hoping that if he can bring Butch in alive , he can redeem himself for his past mistake . Phillip , eight years old , has never participated in Halloween or Christmas celebrations . Escaping with Butch , however , he experiences a freedom which he finds exhilarating , as Butch gladly allows him the kind of indulgences he has been forbidden all along , including the wearing of a shoplifted Casper the Friendly Ghost costume . Gradually , Phillip becomes increasingly aware of his surroundings , and with constant encouragement from Butch , seems to acquire the ability to make independent decisions on what is wrong and right . For his part , Butch slowly finds himself drawn into giving Phillip the kind of fatherly presence which he himself never had . Butch and Phillip try to make it to New Mexico , but find out that the highway they are driving on is unfinished . While asleep in their car in a cornfield , they encounter Mack , a farmer and his family , Lottie his wife , and his grandson Cleveland . Mack frequently abuses Cleveland , which Butch tries to tolerate , but when they figure out who he is , he puts a stop to it . He beats Mack and plans on killing him , but Phillip takes his gun and shoots him in the stomach . Then he gets out of the house , drops the gun into a well , throws the car keys away and runs across a meadow . Butch follows him and rests at the tree Phillip has climbed . In the following dialogue Phillip apologizes for shooting Butch who tells him he did the right thing . Red s team surrounds the place where Phillip and Butch are situated , the latter sending the boy away to his mother , who is with Red s team . Unwilling to leave the already wounded Butch , the boy runs back and hugs him â a gesture which , along with his knowledge of Butch s character and background , convinces Red that he can resolve the situation peacefully . His plans are thwarted , however , when Bobby Lee , mistaking one of Butch s gestures to suppose he is about to draw a gun , fires a shot into his chest and kills him . The move leaves Red angry and frustrated at his inability to save Butch and take him alive . Red punches Bobby Lee and walks away . Phillip is reunited with his mother , and the two of them fly away in a helicopter .
