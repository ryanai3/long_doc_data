In 2003 , Maya ( Jessica Chastain ) , a young U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officer , has spent her entire brief career , since being recruited for the agency , focused solely on gathering intelligence related to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden ( Ricky Sekhon ) , following the terrorist organization s September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 . She is reassigned to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan to work with a fellow officer , Dan ( Jason Clarke ) . During the first months of her assignment , Maya often accompanies Dan to a black site for his continuing interrogation of Ammar al-Baluchi ( Reda Kateb ) , a detainee with suspected links to several of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks . Dan subjects the detainee to approved torture interrogation techniques , i.e. , stress positions , hooding , subjection to deafening noise , sleep deprivation , waterboarding , and humiliation . After failing to get al-Baluchi to give up information on an attack in Saudi Arabia , he and Maya eventually trick Ammar into divulging that an old acquaintance , who is using the alias Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti , is working as a personal courier for bin Laden . Other detainees corroborate this , with some claiming Abu Ahmed delivers messages between bin Laden and a man known as Abu Faraj al-Libbi . In 2005 , Abu Faraj is apprehended by the CIA and local police in Pakistan . Maya is allowed to interrogate him , but he continues to deny knowing a courier with such a name . Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed . Maya spends the next five years sifting through masses of data and information , using a variety of technology , hunches , and sharing insights . She concentrates on finding Abu Ahmed , theorizing that he is the best way to find bin Laden . In 2008 , she is caught up in the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing . Dan , departing on reassignment , warns Maya about a possible change in politics , suggesting that the new administration may prosecute those officers who had been involved in interrogations . Maya s fellow officer and friend Jessica ( Jennifer Ehle ) is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack . That same day , a grieving Maya receives an interrogation video of a Jordanian detainee , who claims the man previously identified from a photograph as Abu Ahmed is a man he personally buried in 2001 . Several CIA officers – Maya s seniors – conclude the target who could be Abu Ahmed is long dead , and that they have searched a false trail for nine years . Sometime later , a fellow analyst researching Moroccan intelligence archives comes to Maya and suggests that Abu Ahmed is Ibrahim Sayeed , a suspect who had come to CIA attention shortly after 9/11 . Realizing her lead may still be alive , Maya contacts Dan , now a senior officer at the CIA headquarters . She theorizes that the CIA s supposed photograph of Abu Ahmed was actually of his brother , Habib , as he was said to bear a striking resemblance to Ibrahim and was known to have been killed in Afghanistan , and points out that Abu Ahmed s death in 2001 contradicts Ammar s account . Dan uses CIA funds to purchase a Lamborghini for a Kuwaiti prince in exchange for the telephone number of Sayeed s mother . The CIA traces calls to the mother and quickly identifies one suspicious caller who persistently uses tradecraft to avoid detection . Maya concludes that the caller is Abu Ahmed , and with the support of her supervisors , numerous CIA operatives are deployed to search for and identify the caller . They locate him in his vehicle and eventually track him to a large urban compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan , near the Pakistan Military Academy . As Maya leaves her residence one morning , she is attacked by multiple gunmen , but the bullet-proof glass in her car saves her . Knowing that she has been blacklisted by al-Qaeda and there will be more attempts on her life if she stays , her superiors remove her from the field and send Maya home to Washington , D.C . The CIA puts the compound under heavy surveillance for several months , using a variety of methods . Although they are confident from circumstantial evidence that bin Laden is there , they can not prove this photographically . Meanwhile , the President s National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with producing a plan to capture or kill bin Laden if it can be confirmed that he is in the compound . An agency team devises a plan to use two top-secret stealth helicopters ( developed at Area 51 ) flown by the Army s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to secretly enter Pakistan and insert members of DEVGRU and the CIA s SAD/SOG to raid the compound . Before briefing President Barack Obama , the CIA Director holds a meeting of his top officials , who assess only a 60–80 % chance that bin Laden , rather than another high-value target , is living in the compound . Maya , also in attendance , states the chances are 100 % . The raid is approved and is executed on May 2 , 2011 . Although execution is complicated by one of the helicopters ' crashing , the SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people within the compound , among them a man on the compound s top floor who is revealed to be bin Laden . They bring bin Laden s body back to a U.S. base in Jalalabad , Afghanistan , where Maya visually confirms the identity of the corpse . Maya is last seen boarding a military transport to return to the U.S. and sitting in its vast interior as its only passenger . The pilot asks her where she wants to go , but she does not reply . As the plane s hangar door closes , Maya begins to cry softly .
