The film begins with Emil Slovak ( Karel Roden ) and Oleg Razgul ( Oleg Taktarov ) arriving in America . They were former criminals and , after getting out of prison , have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia ( or somewhere in Czech Republic ) . Within minutes of arriving , Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment . They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share . He does n't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera . The couple s friend , Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova ( Vera Farmiga ) , witnesses the murders from the bathroom ; but she escapes before they can kill her , too . To hide the crime , Emil burns down the apartment . Jordy Warsaw ( Edward Burns ) is an arson investigator and is called to the case . Eddie Flemming ( Robert De Niro ) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene . Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story . Everywhere he goes , the townspeople cheer him on . Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together . While checking out the crowd outside , Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention . When he finally gets to where she was , she s gone . Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl s wallet and asks for a Czech girl . When Honey ( Noelle Evans ) , a regular call girl arrives , he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service . Oleg tapes the murder . In fact , he tapes everything he can , trying to be the next Frank Capra . Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service . Rose Hearn ( Charlize Theron ) runs the service and tells them that the girl they re looking for does n't work for her but rather a local hairdresser . She also mentions a couple of other guys who just asked her the same questions . Flemming and Warsaw rush to the hairdresser , but they arrive just after Emil and Oleg warn Daphne to keep quiet . As Flemming puts the girl into his squad car , he notices Oleg taping them from across the street . A foot chase begins , culminating in Flemming s regular partner Leon Jackson ( Avery Brooks ) being hit with a glass bottle and his wallet stolen . Emil finds a card with Flemming s name and address in it . He is jealous of Flemming s celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can do whatever they want and get away with it . On the night that Flemming is to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas ( Melina Kanakaredes ) , Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and tape him to a chair . While Oleg is recording , Emil explains his plan to Flemming : He will kill him and sell the tape to Top Story . After being committed to an insane asylum , he will declare that he is actually sane . Since he ca n't be tried again , he will get off , collecting the royalties from his books and movies . Flemming starts attacking them with his chair ( while still taped to it ) and almost gets them , but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest , mortally wounding him . Emil then suffocates him with the pillow and kills him . The entire city is in mourning , and Emil calls Robert Hawkins ( Kelsey Grammer ) , the host of Top Story , to tell him he has a tape of the killing and is willing to sell it . Robert pays him $ 1 million for the tape . Warsaw and the entire police force are furious at Robert , as they ca n't believe that he would air it , especially since his main reporter is Nicolette . On the night it is aired , Emil and Oleg sit in a Planet Hollywood to watch it with the rest of the public . Halfway through the airing , the other spectators realize that Emil and Oleg are right there with them and panic . The police come and arrest Emil , while Oleg escapes . They put Emil in Warsaw s squad car but instead of taking him to the police station , Warsaw takes him to an abandoned warehouse where he is going to kill him . The police arrive just in time and take Emil away . Everything goes as planned as Emil is now a celebrity and is pleading insanity . His lawyer agrees to work for 30 % of the royalties Emil will receive for his story . Meanwhile , Oleg is jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving . While being led away with his lawyer and all the media , Warsaw gets into an argument with the lawyer , with the Top Story crew taping the whole thing . Oleg gives Robert the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming , proving he was sane the whole time . Robert shouts out to Emil and explains to him the evidence he now has . Emil pushes a policeman down , takes his gun and shoots Oleg . Emil grabs Nicolette , who is covering the story , and threatens to shoot her . He is finally cornered by the police and Warsaw . Against orders , Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest . An officer shouts that Oleg is still alive . Robert rushes to him to get footage , just as Oleg says the final few words to the movie he s taping just before he dies . Warsaw punches out Robert and leaves the scene as the police all smile with approval .
