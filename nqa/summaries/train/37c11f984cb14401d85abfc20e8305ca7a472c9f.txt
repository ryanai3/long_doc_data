Kyle Pratt ( Jodie Foster ) , an American aircraft engineer employed in Berlin , Germany , is widowed with a six-year-old daughter Julia after her husband David falls off the roof of their building to his death . Kyle decides to bury him in their hometown back in the U.S. , on Long Island , New York . They fly aboard a passenger aircraft , the engines of which Kyle helped design . After falling asleep , Kyle wakes to find that Julia is missing . She begins to panic , and Captain Marcus Rich ( Sean Bean ) is forced to conduct a search . None of the passengers remembers seeing her daughter ; Julia has no register in either the Berlin airport or the passenger manifest ; and Kyle can not find Julia s boarding pass . Marcus and the other crew members suspect that Kyle has become unhinged by her husband s death and has imagined bringing her daughter aboard . One flight attendant , Stephanie ( Kate Beahan ) , is particularly unsympathetic . Faced with the crew s growing skepticism regarding her daughter s existence , Kyle becomes more and more desperate . Because of her increasingly erratic , panicked behavior , Air Marshal Gene Carson ( Peter Sarsgaard ) is ordered to handcuff and guard her . Capt . Rich receives a wire from the hospital in Berlin , saying Julia was with her father when he fell off the roof and also died of internal injuries . Kyle furiously denies it . The crew believes she is delusional . A therapist , Lisa ( Greta Scacchi ) , tries to console her , causing Kyle to doubt her own sanity until she notices that a heart Julia had drawn earlier on the window next to her seat is real . Kyle is emboldened and convinces the therapist to let her use the bathroom . Instead of doing so , she climbs into the upper compartment and sabotages the aircraft s electronics , deploying the oxygen masks and interrupting lighting . She uses the chaos to take a dumbwaiter to the lower freight deck . She desperately searches for Julia and finally opens her husband s casket , at which she emotionally breaks down . Carson finds her , puts her in handcuffs and escorts her back , announcing that she will be arrested as soon as they land . Kyle makes a final plea to Carson that she needs to search the plane upon landing . Carson considers for a moment , then decides to speak to the captain . He sneaks back into the freight deck to remove two explosives and a detonator concealed in David s casket , then climbs down to the Avionics Section , revealing Julia ( Marlene Lawston ) who is sleeping ( presumably drugged ) . He attaches the explosives to the side of the platform . At this point , it is revealed that Carson , Stephanie , and the mortuary director in Berlin ( Christian Berkel ) are part of a conspiracy . Carson tells Rich that Kyle is a hijacker and is threatening to blow up the aircraft unless the airline transfers $ 50 million into a bank account . The conspirators actually murdered David and abducted Julia to frame Kyle . Carson tells an unnerved Stephanie that he intends to blow up the aircraft , killing the unconscious Julia and leaving Kyle dead with the detonator in her hand . After making an emergency landing at Goose Bay Airport in Goose Bay , Labrador , Canada , the passengers exit the aircraft as the tarmac is surrounded by U.S. FBI agents . As the captain is leaving , Kyle runs to speak to him with Carson in tow . The captain demands she give up the charade , stating the $ 50 million she demanded has been paid . Realizing the truth , Kyle decides to take advantage of the role of hijacker , demanding Carson stay on board and the crew disembark . Carson hesitates but realizes that , if he refuses , it would be seen that the charade was his . As soon as the plane s door closes , Kyle knocks Carson unconscious with a fire extinguisher , handcuffs him to a rail , and takes the detonator from his pocket . Stephanie comes out of hiding . Carson regains consciousness and fires at Kyle with a concealed gun , sending her running . He chases after Kyle , shooting , until she locks herself in the cockpit . She opens a hatch door to the plane s attic and throws out a binder to fool him . Carson hears the upstairs thud and leaves . Kyle exits and encounters a guilt-ridden Stephanie , who panics and flees the plane . Kyle searches Avionics and finds the unconscious Julia . Carson soon follows and , while searching , reveals to her how he secretly gagged and dumped her daughter into the food bin and disparages the passengers who would never care enough to notice . Carson points his gun to where Julia lay before but finds it empty . He turns around and sees Kyle carrying Julia into the hatch of the cargo hold , with the detonator in hand . Carson shoots at her as she closes the door . With the non-combustible walls of the hold to protect them , Kyle detonates the explosives while leaning on David s coffin , killing Carson . As Kyle carries her daughter out onto the tarmac , all the passengers are shocked upon realizing that she had been telling the truth the whole time . At the airport terminal , Capt . Rich comments to Kyle on how much the two of them look alike before apologizing for his skepticism . Stephanie is led away by the FBI in handcuffs . An agent approaches Kyle and asks her to identify the mortuary director in Berlin who has been detained . Kyle carries the still unconscious Julia through the crowd of passengers , and one of the Arab passengers helps pick up her bag , as an act of respect and forgiveness for her having earlier suspected him of being involved in the kidnapping . Before loading her daughter into a van to take them away , Julia wakes up and sleepily asks Are we there yet ? as they prepare to leave .
