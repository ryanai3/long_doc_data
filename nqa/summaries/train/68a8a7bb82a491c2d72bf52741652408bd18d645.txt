Manhattan press agent Sidney Falco ( Tony Curtis ) has been unable to gain mentions for his clients in J.J. Hunsecker s ( Burt Lancaster ) influential , nationally syndicated newspaper column of late because of Falco s failure to make good on a promise to break up the romance between Hunsecker s younger sister Susan ( Susan Harrison ) and musician Steve Dallas ( Martin Milner ) , an up-and-coming jazz guitarist . Falco is losing money and clients . Given one last chance by the bullying , intimidating Hunsecker , he schemes to plant a false rumor in a rival column that Dallas is a dope-smoking Communist , then encourages Hunsecker to rescue Dallas s reputation , certain that the headstrong boyfriend will reject Hunsecker s favor and end up looking bad to Susan . The plan works , in a wayâDallas ca n't resist insulting Hunsecker s methods , and , forced to choose between them , the timid Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to protect him from her brother . Hunsecker , however , is enraged by Dallas s insults to him after a brief confrontation . He decides to ruin the boy after all ( against Falco s advice ) and wants to have marijuana planted on the musician , then have him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police Lt. Harry Kello ( Emile Meyer ) . It is such a dirty trick that even Falco wants no part of it , at least until Hunsecker promises to take a long vacation from his powerful column and turn it over to Falco in his absence . At a nightclub , Falco slips the marijuana cigarettes into a pocket of a coat belonging to Dallas , who is accosted by Kello outside the club . Falco is summoned to Hunsecker s penthouse apartment , only to find Susan there by herself and about to attempt suicide . He grabs her just as her brother walks in , but Hunsecker , encouraged by Susan s silence , accuses Falco of trying to assault Susan and begins beating the physically weaker Falco . Falco pleads that he only came to the apartment at Hunsecker s request , prompting Hunsecker to tell Falco that he never called him . As Susan stops Hunsecker from further harming him , Falco realizes that Susan placed the call in order to bring the men to blows . In a climactic confrontation , Falco reveals to Susan that it was her brother who ordered him to destroy Dallas s reputation and their relationship . Hunsecker makes a call to Kello to come after Falco , who tries to flee but is caught in Times Square by the brutal cop . Back in the penthouse , Susan , her bags packed , acknowledges to her brother that she attempted suicide , considering death preferable to living with him . She walks out on him , saying that she will go to Dallas and tells Hunsecker that she pities rather than hates him . A mortified J.J. looks at his sister from his apartment , as she walks out into the daylight .
