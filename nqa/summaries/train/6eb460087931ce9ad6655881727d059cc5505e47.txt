In 1845 , James Howlett , a boy living in Canada , witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan . The trauma activates the boy s mutation : bone claws protrude from his knuckles , and he kills Thomas , who reveals that he is James s real father . James flees along with Thomas s son Victor Creed , who is thus James s half-brother . They spend the next century as soldiers , fighting in the American Civil War , both World Wars , and the Vietnam War . In Vietnam , Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman , and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him . James defends Victor and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad , which they survive . Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody , and offers them membership in Team X , a group of mutants including Agent Zero , Wade Wilson , John Wraith , Fred Dukes , and Chris Bradley . They join the team for a few years , with James now using the alias Logan , but the group s ( especially Victor s ) disregard for human life causes James to leave . Six years later , James ( now using the name Logan ) is working as a lumberjack in Canada , where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox . Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work . Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed , and he thinks someone is targeting the team s members . Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker , but after finding Kayla s bloodied body in the woods , Logan realizes Victor is responsible . He finds him at a local bar , but Logan loses the subsequent fight . Afterward , Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue , and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge . Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium , a virtually indestructible metal . Once the procedure is complete , Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased , but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm , where an elderly couple take him in . Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan . Logan takes down Zero s helicopter , killing him , and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor . Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club . Fred explains that Victor is still working for Stryker , hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory , located at a place called The Island . Fred mentions Remy Gambit LeBeau , is the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location . John and Logan find LeBeau in New Orleans , then both fight Victor , who kills John and extracts his DNA . Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured , Gambit takes Logan to Stryker s facility on Three Mile Island . Logan learns that Kayla is alive , having been coerced by Stryker into keeping tabs on him in exchange for her sister s safety . However , Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service , claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation . Stryker activates Wade , now known as Weapon XI , a mutant killer with the powers of multiple mutants , who he refers to as the Deadpool . While Logan and Victor join forces to fight Weapon XI , Kayla is mortally wounded leading the Island s captive mutants â including a teenager named Scott Summers â to safety . The mutants are subsequently rescued by Professor Charles Xavier . Logan decapitates Weapon XI , destroying one of the cooling towers in the process . Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets , rendering him unconscious . Before Stryker can shoot Kayla , she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed . Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory . He sees Kayla s body , but does not recognize her , and leaves the island . In a mid-credits scene , Stryker is detained for questioning by some MPs in connection with the death of his superior , General Munson , whom Stryker did in fact kill after Munson declared his intention to shut down Stryker s project . In a post-credits scene , Logan tells a Japanese barmaid he s drinking to remember . In another , Deadpool is shown to still be alive .
