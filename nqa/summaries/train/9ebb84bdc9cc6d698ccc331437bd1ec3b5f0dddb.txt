Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem , Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career . When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out , she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded . Taking her lawyer s advice , she copies financial records and several other files from her husband s computer onto a CD . These files contain a rambling , meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities . When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies , a local gym , by a careless law firm employee , it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke , who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes ' bank records , and especially , Cox s diatribes , to be highly sensitive government information . After getting the data traced back to Osbourne , who thinks his memoirs have been stolen , Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward , with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery . When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong , Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy , offering more information in return for monetary compensation . With no other data to give them , Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes ' home to get more files from their computer . Meanwhile , Osbourne s increasingly erratic behavior , aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda , prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings . She changes the locks on their house , forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay . With her husband out of the picture , Katie invites her lover , Harry Pfarrer , to move in . A womanizing , multi-adulterous deputy U.S . Marshal , Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda . Harry finds Chad , whom Linda sent to find more files on Osbourne , hiding in a wardrobe in the Coxes ' home , panics , and fatally shoots Chad . Two days later at the CIA headquarters , Palmer Smith , Osbourne s former superior , and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy . The two men are perplexed , given Osbourne s low-level security clearance , the material delivered to the Russians being of no importance to anyone , and the apparent motive of all involved parties remaining unknown . Smith is told to maintain observation until the situation makes sense . Harry , burdened by keeping the day prior s events secret , gets into an argument with Katie and decides to leave the house . On his way out , he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days . After tackling him to the ground , Harry finds out that the man is a private detective hired by his wife Sandra Sandy to gather evidence for impending divorce proceedings . Sandy is shown to be having an extramarital liaison of her own . Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda , who confides in Harry that Chad is missing . Harry agrees to help find Chad . The next morning , Harry and Linda meet in a park , and Linda provides him with more information about Chad s disappearance . When Linda mentions the name Osbourne Cox , Harry figures out that Chad is the man he shot . He panics , realizes that there are strange men in the park ( most likely the CIA people trailing Linda ) and flees , assuming Linda is a spy . Linda then turns to Ted Treffon , the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies , who has unrequited feelings for her and has been critical of Linda and Chad s scheming thus far . Believing the Russians have kidnapped Chad , he agrees to go to the Coxes ' home to search Osbourne s computer . Unemployed and having spent the past several days living on a small boat , Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that Katie has emptied his bank accounts and , no longer having keys , decides to break into the house to get some of his personal belongings . Finding Ted in the basement , Osbourne initially takes him to be Katie s lover . He soon realizes Ted s affiliation with Linda and what he refers to as the league of morons he feels that he has been struggling against his whole life and kills Ted . At CIA headquarters a few days later , Palmer and his director try to understand what exactly happened . It is revealed that while trying to board a flight to Venezuela , Harry was detained because his name was on a hot list and that the CIA is holding Linda , who is promising to play ball and sit on it if they will pay for her plastic surgery . A CIA agent shot Osbourne during his assault on Ted and the bullet has put Osbourne in a coma . The director instructs Palmer to let Harry fly to Venezuela ( as that country has no extradition treaty with the US and therefore will not send him back ) and pay for Linda s surgery . The director and Palmer conclude that despite their oversight and the unusual events that have unfolded , there appears to be no lesson for the agency to have learned , be it moral , espionage , or otherwise . I guess we learned not to do it again , the director concludes ( despite not knowing exactly what they did ) , and closes his file . Meanwhile , staff at the Russian embassy have dismissed the contents of Cox s ramblings in the files from his computer - arguably the one factor that started off the entire chain of events - as drivel .
