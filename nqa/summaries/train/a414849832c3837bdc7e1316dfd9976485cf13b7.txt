Harry ( Danny Glover ) , an enigmatic old friend from the South , comes to visit Gideon ( Paul Butler ) and his wife Suzie ( Mary Alice ) , who have n't seen him for many years , who are delighted to see him again , and who insist that he stay with them for as long as he would like . Gideon and Suzie live in South Central Los Angeles , though they retain some of their rural southern ways , including raising chickens in the backyard . Harry has a charming , down-home manner , but his presence brings to a crisis the simmering trouble that is already in the familyâespecially as regards the younger son , Samuel or Baby Brother , and his relation to his parents , wife , and older brother , Junior ( Carl Lumbly ) . His disruptive presence is dangerous ( his influence threatens to break up Samuel s marriage and seems to be related to the illness that puts Gideon in bed in serious condition for a couple weeks ) , but ultimately purgative : Gideon s extended family is much more cohesive as a result of Harry s visit . The storm accompanying the wound Suzie suffers when she grasps the knife that Samuel and Junior are struggling over during their climactic fight clears while the two brothers quietly reconcile ( during a long wait in an emergency room ) and , similarly , the simmering anger that Harry seemed to bring to a boil is also dissipated . Harry s death just before the end of the film suggests , ambiguously , that he has been to a degree a self-sacrificing savior of the family .
