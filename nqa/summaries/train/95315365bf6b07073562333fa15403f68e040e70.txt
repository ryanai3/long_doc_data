In May 1805 , during the Napoleonic Wars , Captain Jack Aubrey of HMS Surprise is ordered to pursue the French privateer Acheron , and Sink , Burn or take her [ as ] a Prize . The British warship is ambushed by Acheron ; Surprise is heavily damaged , while its own cannon fire does not penetrate the enemy ship s hull . Using smaller boats , the crew of Surprise tow the ship into a fog bank and evade pursuit . Meanwhile , Aubrey learns from a crewman who saw Acheron being built that it is heavier and faster than Surprise , and the senior officers consider the ship out of their class . Aubrey notes that such a ship could tip the balance of power in Napoleon s favour if allowed to plunder the British whaling fleet at will . He orders pursuit of Acheron , rather than returning to port for repairs . Acheron again ambushes Surprise , but Aubrey slips away in the night by using a clever decoy buoy and ships lamps . Following the privateer south , Surprise rounds Cape Horn and heads to the Galapagos Islands , where Aubrey is sure Acheron will prey on Britain s whaling fleet . The ship s doctor , Maturin , is interested in the islands ' flora and fauna , and Aubrey promises his friend several days ' exploration time . When Surprise reaches the Galapagos they recover the survivors of a whaling ship destroyed by Acheron . Realizing the ship is close , Aubrey hastily pursues the privateer . Maturin feels that Aubrey is going back on his word , and is following Acheron more out of pride than duty . Marine officer Captain Howard attempts to shoot an albatross , but accidentally hits Maturin . The surgeon s mate informs Aubrey that the bullet and a piece of cloth it took with it must be removed , but the operation should be performed on solid ground . Despite closing on Acheron , Aubrey turns around and takes the doctor back to the Galapagos . Maturin performs surgery on himself using a mirror . Giving up the pursuit of the privateer , Aubrey grants Maturin the chance to explore the island and gather specimens before they head for home . On crossing the island looking for a species of flightless cormorant , the doctor discovers Acheron anchored on the other side of the island . Abandoning most of his specimens , Maturin warns Aubrey , and Surprise readies for battle . Due to Acheron s sturdy hull , Surprise must get in close to deal damage . After observing the camouflage ability of one of Maturin s specimens—a stick insect—Aubrey disguises Surprise as a whaling ship ; he hopes the French would move close to capture the valuable ship rather than destroy it . The Acheron falls for the disguise and is disabled . Aubrey leads boarding parties across the wreckage , engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat before the ship is captured . Looking for the Acheron s captain , Aubrey is directed to the sickbay , where a French doctor tells him the captain is dead and offers Aubrey the commander s sword . Acheron and Surprise are repaired ; while Surprise will remain in the Galapagos , the captured Acheron is to be taken to Valparaíso . As Acheron sails away , Maturin mentions that their doctor had died months ago . Realising the French captain deceived him by pretending to be the ship s doctor , Aubrey gives the order to change course to intercept the Acheron and escort her to Valparaíso , and for the crew to assume battle stations . Maturin is again denied the chance to explore the Galapagos , but Aubrey wryly notes that since the bird he seeks is flightless , it s not going anywhere , and the two play a selection of Luigi Boccherini as the crew assumes battle stations and the Surprise turns in pursuit of the Acheron .
