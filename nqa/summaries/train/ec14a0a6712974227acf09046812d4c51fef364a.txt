Scientist Dr. Sebastian Caine ( Bacon ) has developed a serum that can make a subject invisible . His team of scientists , which includes ex-girlfriend Dr. Linda McKay ( Shue ) and Dr. Matt Kensington ( Brolin ) , eventually enable the serum to work on a female gorilla and restore the animal back to visibility . Sebastian once again becomes obsessed with Linda while unbeknownst to him , she has become involved with Matt . Instead of reporting his success to the military , Sebastian lies to the oversight committee , which includes his mentor Dr. Howard Kramer ( Devane ) , convincing his team to go right into human testing . The procedure is performed on Sebastian . It is successful and Sebastian turns completely invisible . He then enjoys sneaking around the lab in order to scare and play pranks on his fellow co-workers . They become worried that he is taking it too far . After three days , however , he is unable to revert to visibility . Sebastian is quarantined in the laboratory due to his condition and the other researchers construct a latex mask for him to wear around the lab . Unable to cope with the isolation , he defies instructions and heads to his apartment to bring some things back to the lab . There , he happens to notice his neighbor disrobing and goes to her apartment where he rapes her . Linda warns him that if he leaves again , she and Matt will tell the committee about the experiment . Ignoring their threat , Sebastian assembles a device that runs a video loop of his heat signature in his quarters . He leaves the lab again and spies on Linda and Matt , becoming enraged when he sees them having sex . The team soon discover that they have been watching a recording and that Sebastian has been escaping without their knowledge . Linda and Matt go to Dr. Kramer s house and confess their experiments . After they leave , Kramer attempts to warn the military but Sebastian , who has followed Linda and Matt to the house , cuts off Kramer s phone connection before drowning him in his swimming pool . The next day , Sebastian waits until all of the team is in the lab and then disables the phones and the elevator codes except for his own . He removes his clothing and latex mask and invisible , begins his killing spree , with Janice being his first victim . Linda and the others hide in the lab , while Matt and Carter take tranquilizer guns to hunt for Sebastian , using thermal imaging goggles . While on top of a pipe , Sebastian throws Carter toward a steel bar , which hits his carotid artery , and leaves him mortally wounded . Matt tries to shoot Sebastian , but is almost killed until Linda drags him to safety . After Carter dies from his injuries , Sarah heads to the freezer to get blood for a transfusion but is killed by Sebastian . He then kills Frank with a crowbar when he lets his guard down , and locks an injured Matt and Linda in the freezer-store room , leaving them to freeze to death . Linda then constructs an electromagnet using a defibrillator and other equipment , to open the freezer door . She then gathers parts to assemble a flamethrower . Sebastian goes to the lab and creates nitroglycerin and puts it in a centrifuge with a timer which is meant to destroy the facility after he leaves ; he smashes the keyboard so nobody can stop the machine . Just as he enters the elevator to leave , Linda appears and fires the flamethrower at him . Sebastian barely manages to escape the flames and the two fight . Just as she is about to lose , Matt appears and hits Sebastian with the crowbar . Sebastian recovers and approaches Matt and Linda from behind with the crowbar but Matt deflects the blow , throwing Sebastian into a nearby circuit box , apparently electrocuting him and rendering him partially visible . Linda and Matt find the nitroglycerin about to explode and decide to climb up the elevator shaft to escape . The two are almost out when an injured and partially visible Sebastian appears . He fights with Linda , and forcibly kisses her one last time , before she grabs the elevator cable and knocks the car loose , sending Sebastian falling to his death into the explosion in the shaft below . Linda and Matt emerge from the burning laboratory and medics take them away in an ambulance .
