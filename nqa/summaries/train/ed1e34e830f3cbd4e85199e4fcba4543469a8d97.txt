Three escaped convicts led by Lednov kill three cowboys in Nevada and steal their clothes . They ride on looking for revenge against a rancher , Clay Phillips , who is warned by friend Jed Graham to get out of town . Clay and younger brother Steve head toward Sonora , California with a herd of horses . They come across four stranded saloon girls , Mary , Marcia , Elaine and Helen , with a broken wagon wheel . Helen s fiance turns up to take her home . Elaine , who is depressed and ill , flees . Steve saves her and they end up at the Wyatt ranch , where it turns out Elaine is a long-missing daughter . Back on the trail , Helen decides to stay with an Irishman named Fowler who has struck gold . An argument later leads Mary to steal Clay s wagon , which act is quickly discovered by Clay and Steve . During the short chase , the wagon becomes detached from the horses and plummets into the adjacent creek . Clay dashes into the water and retrieves a semi-conscious and soaking wet Mary , who quickly comes to . Clay s concern for her well-being suddenly returns to anger as Mary , seeing the rest of her clothing floating away downstream , is concerned about that instead of Clay s wagon that she just destroyed . This only solidifies Clay s resolve that she not continue with him and Steve onto Sonora and so puts her on a passing stagecoach to the next town . In the meanwhile , Lednov , in pursuit , comes upon the camp of Helen and Fowler and so roughs up Helen and kills Fowler to make her reveal where the Phillips brothers have gone . Upon finding them , a gunfight ensues , in which Clay and Steve are victorious , though Steve is wounded . Needing medical attention , Clay takes him to the town doctor where Mary appears and returns to Clay s arms .
