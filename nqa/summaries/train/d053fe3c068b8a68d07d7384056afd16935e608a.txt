After having led numerous military battles against the English during the Hundred Years ' War , Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen , Normandy to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English . On 30 May 1431 Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court . Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France , but she remains steadfast . One or two of them , believing that she is indeed a saint , support her . The authorities then resort to deception . A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France , telling her to trust in the bearer . When that too fails , Joan is taken to view the torture chamber , but the sight , though it causes her to faint , does not intimidate her . When she is threatened with burning at the stake , she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession . However , the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment . As the jailer shaves her head , she realises she has been unfaithful to God . She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession . As more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass . She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution . She helps the executioner tie her bonds . The crowds gather and the fire is lit . As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out you have burned a saint . The troops prepare for a riot . As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed . Joan is consumed by the flames but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven .
