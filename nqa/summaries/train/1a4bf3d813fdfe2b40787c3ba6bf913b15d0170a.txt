Under the watchful eyes of Father Silvano Bentivoglio ( Carmen Argenziano ) and Dr. Vittoria Vetra ( Ayelet Zurer ) , the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) initiates the Large Hadron Collider and creates three vials of antimatter particles larger than any ever been produced before . Almost immediately , Father Silvano is killed and one of the vials of antimatter goes missing . At the same time , the Roman Catholic Church is mourning the sudden death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome and prepares for the papal conclave to elect the next Pope . The Camerlengo , Father Patrick McKenna ( Ewan McGregor ) , assumes temporary control of the Vatican . Before the conclave enters seclusion , four of the preferiti ( the favorite cardinals to be elected pope ) are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the Illuminati . In a video message , he threatens to kill one candidate every hour starting at 8pm and to destroy all of Vatican City at midnight , using the missing vial of antimatter as a bomb . The Vatican summons symbologist Robert Langdon ( Tom Hanks ) from Harvard University and Vetra to help them save the four preferiti and locate the vial . Langdon listens to the Illuminati s message and deduces the four cardinals will die at the four altars of the Path of Illumination , marked by statues of angels in locations relevant to the four classical elements . Over the objections of Commander Maximilian Richter , head of the Swiss Guard , but with McKenna s consent , Langdon is granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives . He examines Galileo Galilei s banned book with Vetra . Following the clues and accompanied by Inspector General Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the Vatican Gendarmerie Corps , they arrive at the Chigi Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo . There they find Cardinal Ebner dead , suffocated with soil and branded with an ambigrammatic word Earth . They verify the second location is the crowded Saint Peter s Square and arrive just as a bloody Cardinal LamassĂŠ emerges with his chest branded with Air . Vetra unsuccessfully attempts to perform CPR on him , only to discover his lungs had been punctured , while the assassin slips through the crowd . While Vetra studies Silvano s diaries , Langdon , Olivetti and Vincenzi locate the third church , Santa Maria della Vittoria , and arrive to see Cardinal Guidera , branded Fire and suspended above a burning pile of wood . A gunfight erupts between the assassin and the officers , with Olivetti and Vincenzi being killed in the process . Langdon manages to escape , but not before being spotted by the assassin . Langdon convinces two Carabinieri officers to take him to the next location and the trio race to the Water altar , the Fountain of the Four Rivers , just as the assassin arrives in a van . The assassin murders the officers and drops a bound and weighted Cardinal Baggia into the fountain before bidding farewell to Langdon and driving off . With the help of bystanders , Langdon rescues the cardinal , who tells him the Illuminati s lair is Castel Sant'Angelo . There , Langdon and Vetra discover a hidden passageway leading to the Vatican , being used as a hideout for the assassin . Discovering a case with marks for five branding irons , they realize the fifth brand is for the Camerlengo but are confronted by the assassin before they can alert McKenna . The assassin spares their lives once more , stating killing them is not a part of his mission unless they pursue him . He then cryptically warns them to be careful as his contractors are men of God before departing . He escapes to a car left for him by his contractor , but is killed immediately when it explodes upon ignition . Langdon and Vetra rush back to the Vatican where they find Commander Richter hovering over McKenna with a gun , the Vatican symbol branded into McKenna s chest . Richter and Archbishop Simeon are shot by the Guards . As Richter dies before Langdon , he opens his hand to reveal a key which Langdon takes . The stolen antimatter vial is found in St. Peter s Tomb below the church , but the battery life is too low to risk re-connecting it to a battery . McKenna , a former military pilot , seizes the vial and uses an awaiting helicopter to fly above the Vatican . At a high altitude , he parachutes out as the antimatter bomb explodes overhead . McKenna is hailed a hero and savior , and the cardinals move to elect him pope . Langdon and Vetra use Richter s key to watch a security video showing McKenna speaking to Richter before the attack . The video reveals it is McKenna , not the Illuminati , who masterminded the scheme . McKenna reveals he murdered the previous pope because he felt the pope had betrayed the church by trying to bridge the gap between science and religion . Once McKenna had killed the pope , he intended to have himself elected to the papacy whilst rallying the most conservative Cardinals to his side . The recording is shown to the Papal conclave , and when it dawns on McKenna he has been exposed . He flees to a remote recess in the building where he is able to commit suicide by setting himself on fire . The Vatican officially announces McKenna died due to internal injuries suffered during his parachute landing , and Cardinal Baggia is named Pope Luke , with Cardinal Strauss as the new Camerlengo . Strauss thanks Langdon for his assistance and gives Langdon Galileo s Diagramma Veritatis for his research as a gift from himself and Pope Luke , requesting only it be returned to the Vatican once he is finished , and any future references he may make about the Catholic Church in his future publications be done gently , to which Langdon replies , I ll try .
