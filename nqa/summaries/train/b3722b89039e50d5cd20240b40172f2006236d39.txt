She tells their leader , Bill , that she is carrying his baby . He shoots her . Four years later , having survived the attack , the Bride goes to the home of Vernita Green , planning to kill her . Both women were members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad , which has since disbanded ; Vernita now leads a normal suburban family life . They engage in a knife fight , but are interrupted by the arrival of Vernita s young daughter , Nikki . Not wanting to kill Vernita in front of Nikki , the Bride agrees to meet Vernita at night to settle the matter , but Vernita tries to surprise the Bride with a pistol hidden in a box of cereal . The Bride dodges the shot and throws a knife into Vernita s chest , killing her . Four and a half years earlier , police investigate the massacre at the wedding chapel . The sheriff discovers the Bride is alive but comatose . In the hospital , Deadly Viper Elle Driver prepares to assassinate the Bride via lethal injection , but Bill aborts the mission at the last moment , considering it dishonorable to kill the Bride when she can not defend herself .

After learning that her target is Bill , his former student , he forges his finest sword for her . The Bride tracks down O-Ren at a Tokyo restaurant , the House of Blue Leaves , and defeats her yakuza army , including the elite Crazy 88 and O-Ren s bodyguard , schoolgirl Gogo Yubari . She duels with O-Ren in the restaurant s Japanese garden . During the duel O-Ren apologizes to the Bride , who tearfully accepts . They continue and the Bride slices O-Ren s scalp off with a sword stroke .
