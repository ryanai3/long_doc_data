Speed Racer is an 18-year-old whose life and love has always been automobile racing . His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors , in which his brother Spritle , mechanic Sparky , and girlfriend Trixie are also involved . As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother , Rex Racer , who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 , a deadly cross-country racing rally . Now embarking on his own career , Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother s cars , the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6 , but remains primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family . E.P . Arnold Royalton , owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries , offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him . Speed is tempted but declines due to his father s distrust of power-hungry corporations . Angered , Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests , including Royalton himself , to gain profits . Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement . Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector , head of a corporate crimes division . Racer Taejo Togokahn says that he has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000 . Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family s racing business , blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout . Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family , and Inspector Detector s team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally . After they drive together and work naturally as a team , Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise . His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him . With the help of his family and Trixie , Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him , and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race . However , Taejo s arrangement is revealed to be a sham , as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family s company so that they could profit from Royalton s buyout . An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother , and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex . Racer X removes his mask , revealing an unfamiliar face , and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead . Speed returns home , where Taejo s sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo s automatic invitation to the Grand Prix , which Taejo had rejected . The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours . Speed enters the Grand Prix against great odds : Royalton has placed a bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect , and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack Cannonball Taylor . Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor , who uses a cheating device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car . Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras , causing Taylor to crash . Speed wins the race , having successfully exposed Royalton s crimes . While Racer X watches it is revealed in a flashback montage that he really is Rex , who has faked his death and undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance as part of his plan to save his family and the sport of racing . He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family , declaring that he must live with his decision . The Racer family celebrates Speed s victory as Speed and Trixie kiss , and Royalton is sent to jail .
