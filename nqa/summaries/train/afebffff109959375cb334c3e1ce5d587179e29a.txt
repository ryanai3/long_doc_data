In 2001 , Gordon Gekko ( Michael Douglas ) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud . Seven years later , Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good ? , warning about the coming economic downturn . His estranged daughter , Winnie ( Carey Mulligan ) , runs a small , non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore ( Shia LaBeouf ) , a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments ( KZI ) . Jacob is a protĂŠgĂŠ of managing director Louis Zabel ( Frank Langella ) , and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world . Jake is also financially assisting his mother ( Susan Sarandon ) , who has begun a new career selling real estate . When the recession of 2008 hits , Keller Zabel s stock loses more than 50 % of its value . Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James ( Josh Brolin ) , head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz , which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier . Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he can not handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company . A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie , who accepts , then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward . Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel s collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread . Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade : Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie s and Gekko s relationship , and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton s career to seek revenge for Zabel s suicide . Jake , aided by Gekko , learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse . In revenge , Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field owned by Churchill Schwartz . The company loses $ 120 million , but Bretton offers Jake a job , impressed by his initiative . In his new position , Jake convinces Chinese investors to fund the fusion research by Dr. Masters ( Austin Pendleton ) he has been supporting . Bretton is impressed even more . Jake attends a fundraiser with Winnie and pays for a seat at a table for Gekko priced at $ 10,000 . Gekko confronts Bretton about what he did to him and also to Zabel . Bretton mocks him that no one cares what Gekko knows or thinks anymore . Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox ( Charlie Sheen ) , and they discuss their shared experience going to jail . Gekko then follows Winnie outside , where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong , particularly her brother Rudy s suicide . Gekko claims he paid for the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy , who died from an overdose . Winnie forgives him somewhat . As the economy starts to crumble , Bretton and business mentor Julius Steinhardt ( Eli Wallach ) advise federal regulators what drastic actions must be taken . Jake s mother continues to come to him for large sums of money . Winnie then announces to Jake she is pregnant with a boy . After riding motorcycles together , Bretton reveals to Jake that the Chinese investment is going into solar panels and fossil fuels instead of fusion research , leaving Jake furious and feeling betrayed . Gekko proposes a solution , using a $ 100 million trust fund account in Switzerland , which Gekko set up for Winnie in the 1980s , to fund the research and save the company . She signs the money over to Jake , who then entrusts it to Gekko to legitimize the funds for investment in the fusion research company . However , the money never arrives , and Gekko betrays his daughter and Jake by leaving the country with Winnie s $ 100 million . Jake realizes that Gekko has been using him to get the money in the account for his own gain . Winnie then tells Jake to leave , no longer trusting him . Gekko is now in London , running a hugely successful hedgefund-like financial company , capitalized by the $ 100 million . Jake travels there to propose one last trade : Winnie gets her money back , and Gekko can participate in his grandson s life . Gekko , however , refuses . Jake pieces together everything from Keller Zabel s collapse to the economic bailout of Bretton s company and gives the information to Winnie , telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility . Winnie runs the story , and Bretton James is exposed . The investors , including Steinhardt , promptly abandon Bretton and go to Gekko on the back of his $ 1.1 billion return as Bretton finds himself under intense legal scrutiny by the government . Jake has successfully reunited with Winnie in New York , when late one night Gekko appears and tells them that he deposited $ 100 million into the fusion research s account anonymously . He apologizes to them . One year later , Gekko is seen at his grandson Louis s first birthday party , along with Jacob s mother and Jacob and Winnie s friends .
