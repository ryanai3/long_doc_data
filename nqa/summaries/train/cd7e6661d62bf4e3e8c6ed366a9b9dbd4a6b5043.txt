Finn McMissile , a British spy , infiltrates the world s largest untapped oil reserves owned by a group of lemon cars . After being discovered , he flees and fakes his death . Lightning McQueen , now a 4-time Piston Cup champion , returns home to Radiator Springs to enjoy some quiet time , but when Italian formula race car , Francesco Bernoulli , challenges McQueen to the newly created World Grand Prix , led by its creator Sir Miles Axlerod , he and his best friend Mater — along with Luigi , Guido , Fillmore , and Sarge — depart for Tokyo for the first race of the Grand Prix . Meanwhile , the lemons , who are led by weapons designer Professor Zündapp and an unknown mastermind , secretly plot to secure their oil profits by using an Electromagnetic pulse emitter disguised as a camera ( discovered by Finn on the oil platform ) to trigger and destabilize the use of Allinol , a fuel that was created by Axlerod and required for racers to use in the Grand Prix . McMissile and his partner Holley Shiftwell attempt to meet with American spy car Rod Torque Redline at a World Grand Prix promotional event in Tokyo , to receive information about the mastermind . However , Redline is attacked by Zündapp s henchmen , but not before passing his information to Mater before he is captured , who is then mistaken to be the American contact of Holley and Finn . Before killing Redline , Professor Zündapp finds out that Mater was given the information . At the first race , three cars are ignited by the camera , and McQueen falls second in the race after Bernoulli , due to Mater accidentally giving him bad racing advice shortly after evading Zündapp s henchmen with help from Holley and Finn . Mater is soon abducted by Finn and boards his plane , where he helps to identify some of the information he was given . After traveling to Paris to get more information from Finn s old friend , they travel to Italy , where the next race is being held . While the race is being held , Mater infiltrates the criminals ' meeting , just as the camera is used on a few more cars , causing a multi car pileup , while allowing McQueen to finish first . Due to the criminals plan causing Allinol to be perceived as troublesome , Sir Miles Axlerod removes it as a required fuel for the final race . However , when McQueen decides to continue using it , the criminals plot to kill McQueen in the next race in London , which spooks Mater , causing him to blow his cover and allow him , Finn and Holley , to be abducted . Taken to the inside of the clock tower of Big Ben clock in London and tied up in it , while the final race is being held , Mater discovers that the camera did not function on McQueen , but quickly learns the criminals are planning to plant a bomb on him in his pits , causing him to break free and escape . Finn and Holley escape later , but realize that the bomb is on Mater s air filter . Mater soon flees on the race course when McQueen ( who arrived at the pits ) chases after him , while Finn apprehends Professor Zündapp . The other lemons soon arrive and outnumber Finn , Holley , Mater , and McQueen , but they are soon rescued by the arrival of the other Radiator Springs residents . Mater then uses evidence he had seen to reveal that Axlerod is the leader of this plot and placed the bomb on him , whom he soon confronts and forces to deactivate the bomb , before he and the other lemons are taken into custody , foiling the operation . In the end , Mater receives a honorary knighthood from the queen , while Sarge reveals that he changed McQueen s fuel from Allinol to gasoline , hence why the camera did not work on him . Finn and Holley ask if Mater can join them on another mission , but he turns it down . The final scene ends with the World Grand Prix competitors racing each other at Radiator Springs .
