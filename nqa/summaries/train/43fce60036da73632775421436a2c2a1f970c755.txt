Jesse , now a vampire , and Lestat then return the journal to the Talamasca , and walk away , among mortals , into the night . As they exit it is shown that they are now a couple and hold hands while Marius enters the Talamasca . The film closes with a scene of David reading the journal as Marius s voice catches his attention , cheerfully saying , Hello , David .
