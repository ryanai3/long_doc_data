Bank loan officer Carl Allen ( Jim Carrey ) has become withdrawn since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie . He has an increasingly negative outlook on his life and routinely ignores his friends Pete ( Bradley Cooper ) and Rooney ( Danny Masterson ) . An old colleague ( John Michael Higgins ) suggests that he go to a motivational Yes ! seminar with him , which encourages its attendants to seize the opportunity to say Yes ! . Carl attends and meets inspirational guru Terrence Bundley ( Terence Stamp ) . Bundley publicly forces a reluctant Carl to promise to answer Yes ! to every opportunity , request , or invitation that presents itself . Later , Carl says yes to a homeless man s request and is stranded in Elysian Park . Disillusioned , he hikes to a gas station where he meets Allison ( Zooey Deschanel ) , an unorthodox young woman . She gives him a ride back to his car on her scooter and kisses him before leaving . After this positive experience , Carl feels more optimistic about saying yes . However , he refuses oral sex from his elderly neighbor Tillie ( Fionnula Flanagan ) , and then falls down the stairs and is nearly attacked by a dog . Seeing the repercussions of saying no , he goes back to Tillie and to his surprise enjoys the moment . Carl starts to seize every opportunity that comes his way . He renews his friendships with Pete and Rooney ; builds a bond with his boss , Norman ; assists Pete s fiancĂŠe , Lucy ( Sasha Alexander ) , with her bridal shower ; attends Korean language classes ; and much more . He earns a corporate promotion at work and , making use of his guitar lessons , plays Third Eye Blind s song Jumper to persuade a man not to commit suicide . Accepting a band flyer outside of a coffee shop , he sees an idiosyncratic band called Munchausen by Proxy ; the lead singer is Allison . He is charmed by her quirkiness ; she is charmed by his spontaneity and the two begin dating . Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion . Having decided to take the first plane out of town , regardless of its destination , they end up in Lincoln , Nebraska , where they bond more . Allison asks Carl to move in with her and he hesitantly agrees . While checking in for the return flight , Carl and Allison are detained by FBI agents who have profiled him as a potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons , studied Korean , approved a loan to a fertilizer company , met an Iranian , and bought plane tickets at the last minute . Pete , his attorney , travels to Nebraska to explain Carl s odd habits , lessons , and decisions . As she finds out about Carl s motivational covenant , Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere . Deciding that she can no longer trust him , Allison leaves Carl and refuses to return his phone calls . Carl s life takes a turn for the worse and he almost forgets about Lucy s shower . He manages to arrange a major surprise shower , set his friend Norm up with Soo-Mi ( Vivian Bang ) , a Korean girl , and Rooney with Tillie . After the party , Carl receives a tearful phone call from Stephanie , whose new boyfriend has walked out on her . When Carl goes to Stephanie s apartment to comfort her , she kisses him and asks him to spend the night with her . After Carl emphatically says no , his luck takes a turn for the worse and he decides to end his commitment to the covenant . Carl goes to the convention center and hides in the backseat of Terrence s convertible so that he can beg to be released from the covenant . Carl emerges as Terrence drives off , and an oncoming vehicle collides with Terrence . The two are taken to a hospital . After Carl recovers consciousness , Terrence tells Carl that there was no covenant . The starting point was merely to open Carl s mind to other possibilities , not to permanently take away his ability to say no if he needed to . Freed from this restraint , Carl finds Allison teaching a sports-photography lesson and admits that he is not ready to move in with her just yet , but that he genuinely loves her , and they reconcile with a kiss as Allison s students take pictures .
