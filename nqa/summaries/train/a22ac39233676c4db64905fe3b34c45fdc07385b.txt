Meanwhile , King Harold is dying and his ogre son-in-law Shrek and daughter Princess Fiona are to succeed him .

Before dying , Harold tells Shrek of another heir : his nephew , Arthur Pendragon . Prince Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their happily ever after by appealing to the defeats given in their stories . Shrek , Donkey and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Arthur ; as they are sailing away , Fiona yells to Shrek that she is pregnant . The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy , an elite magical boarding school , where they discover Arthur or Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever picked on by everyone . At the school pep rally , Shrek tells Artie he is going to be king of Far Far Away . Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king . Artie tries taking control of the ship and crashes it on a remote island , where they meet Artie s retired wizard teacher , Merlin . Meanwhile , Charming and the other villains attack the castle , but Wolfie , Pinocchio , Gingy , the Three Little Pigs and the Blind Mice stall them long enough for Fiona and her mother Queen Lilian to escape along with Snow White , Rapunzel , Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty and Doris the Ugly Stepsister . One of the Pigs accidentally blurts out that Shrek has gone to retrieve Arthur , and Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track down Shrek . The ladies are put in a tower when Rapunzel betrays them because she loves Charming . Captain Hook and his pirates track Shrek and his friends to Merlin s island , where they attempt to capture Shrek alive and defeat the others . Shrek and Artie defeat the villains , and Hook mentions Charming and the takeover of Far Far Away . Concerned for his wife and future child , Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire . Instead , Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away . The spell works , but causes Puss and Donkey to accidentally switch bodies . They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play . Charming s men arrive , but Artie tricks the knights into not taking them into custody and they break into the castle during rehearsals for the play . Caught in Charming s dressing room , the four are taken captive . Charming prepares to kill Artie , believing he is the next king . To save Artie s life , Shrek tells Charming that Artie was a pawn to take his place as King of Far Far Away . Charming believes Shrek and allows Artie to leave .

While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek , Donkey and Puss free Gingy , Pinocchio , the wolf and pigs , Dragon and Donkey s children . They encounter Artie , and Puss and Donkey explain that Shrek lied to save him . By nightfall , Charming stages a musical in front of the kingdom . Just as Charming is about to defeat Shrek , Fiona , along with Puss , Donkey , the princesses and the fairy tale characters confront the villains . Artie convinces the villains that just because they are being treated like losers does not mean that they have to be losers . Infuriated , Charming lunges at Artie with his sword , but Shrek blocks the blow , so Charming attacks him instead . Shrek , who seems fatally injured , informs Charming that he needs to work on his aim and that the Prince needs to keep looking for his own happily ever after . As Shrek pushes him aside , Dragon knocks Rapunzel s tower on Charming presumably killing him . Artie is then crowned king , and takes the throne . While the kingdom celebrates , Merlin restores Puss and Donkey to their proper bodies , accidentally switching their tails temporarily .
