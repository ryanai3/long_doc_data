Cotton Weary , now living in Los Angeles and the host of a nationally syndicated television show , 100 % Cotton , is called by Ghostface , who demands the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott , who has gone into hiding ever since the events of the second film three years ago . Cotton refuses to cooperate , and when Ghostface comes to his home , both Cotton and his girlfriend Christine are murdered . Detective Mark Kincaid contacts Gale Weathers to discuss the murders , prompting her to travel to Hollywood , where she finds Dewey Riley working as an adviser on the set of Stab 3 , the third film in the film within a film series based on the Ghostface murders . Using a voice changer as a ruse , Ghostface kills Stab 3 actress Sarah Darling . Meanwhile , Sidney is now living in a secluded rural house as a crisis counselor for an abused women s hotline , as she is fearful that another killer may strike . Having discovered Sidney s number , the killer begins taunting her by phone , forcing her out of hiding and drawing her to Hollywood . As the remaining Stab 3 cast , along with Dewey and Gale , gather at the home of Jennifer Jolie , Ghostface kills her bodyguard Steven Stone and uses a gas leak to cause an explosion , killing fellow actor Tom Prinze in the process . Martha Meeks , the sister of Sidney s friend Randy , who was attacked and murdered by Ghostface in the previous film , visits Sidney and the others to drop off a videotape that Randy had made before his death , posthumously warning them that the rules of a horror movie franchise in the third and final film do not apply to anyone , and that any of them , including Sidney , could die . Dewey , Gale , Jennifer , and the remaining Stab 3 actors , Angelina Tyler and Tyson Fox , attend a birthday party for Stab 3 s director Roman Bridger , where Ghostface strikes . Gale discovers Roman s seemingly dead body , with a knife in his chest , in a movie-set coffin in the basement . Angelina , refusing to stick with Gale and Jennifer , wanders off alone before she is murdered . Tyson attempts to fight Ghostface but the killer manages to wound him . Then after a brief chase Ghostface throws him over the balcony killing him . Jennifer tries to escape through a secret passage , but Ghostface finds her and kills her as well . The killer then orders Sidney to the mansion to save Gale and Dewey s lives , as they are being held hostage . When she arrives , Ghostface forces Sidney to remove her firearm , which she does , and Ghostface lures her inside , as Gale and Dewey are bound and gagged . As Sidney is untying Gale and Dewey , Ghostface appears , though Sidney gains the upper hand using a second hidden gun to fight off Ghostface . Detective Kincaid shows up but is knocked out by Ghostface . Sidney flees and hides in a secret screening room where she encounters Ghostface . He reveals himself as Roman , having faked his death and survived being shot due to a bulletproof vest . Roman admits to being Sidney s half-brother , born to their mother Maureen Prescott when she was an actress in Hollywood . Years ago , he had unsuccessfully tried reuniting with her . Bitter over the rejection , Roman would film all the men she philandered with . He showed Billy Loomis the footage of his father with Maureen , which motivated him to kill her ( setting off the events of Scream and Scream 2 ) . However , when he discovered how much fame Sidney got because of those events , Roman snapped and lured Sidney out of hiding . Roman then tells Sidney of his plan to frame her for the murders , and brings out John Milton , who was bound and gagged in a closet , killing him in front of Sidney . Sidney angrily tells Roman that all that has happened is because of his actions and that no one is to blame but him , to take responsibility for his consequences , a fight ensues between Sidney and Roman . Roman shoots Sidney in the chest , seemingly killing her . While preparing for Gale and Dewey to arrive , Roman is now surprised to see that Sidney s body disappeared . As he begins to place a call to Sidney s cellphone to locate her , he instead receives an incoming call from her . This distracts him long enough for Sidney to stab Roman in the back , and he falls . As he slowly dies , Sidney shows him that she too was wearing a bulletproof vest . She then plunges Roman s knife into his chest , apparently killing him . Dewey and Gale arrive , Gale surprised that Roman is the killer . Roman suddenly jumps up and tries to attacks them again , only for Dewey to kill him with a single gunshot to the head . Some time after one morning , Dewey proposes to Gale , and she accepts . Sidney arrives back at her home . Sidney is invited to join Dewey , Gale , and Detective Kincaid to watch a movie . As she goes to join the others , a door behind her opens , but she walks away leaving it as is , finally confident that the murders have ended and she is now safe .
