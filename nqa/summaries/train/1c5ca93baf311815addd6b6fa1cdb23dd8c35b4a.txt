This reminds her of when Edward previously rescued her from an assault , and she sees his image warning her to stay away . Bella discovers that any thrill-seeking activities she engages in evoke Edward s preserved image . She is also comforted by Jacob Black , a cheerful companion who helps to ease her pain over losing Edward . When Jacob suddenly begins avoiding her , Bella discovers that he , and others of his tribe , are descended from a long line of werewolves , and Jacob has just undergone his first transformation .

Soon after , they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks . Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote in favor of that much to Edward and Rosalie s dismay .
