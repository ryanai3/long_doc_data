In 1961 , the financially strapped author Pamela P. L. Travers reluctantly travels from her home in London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney at the urging of her agent , Diarmuid Russell . Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years , having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them . Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney s efforts because she fears what he would do to her character . However , she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing , so she risks losing her house . Still , Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulationsâno animation and unprecedented script approvalâbefore she agrees to go . Travers ' difficult childhood in Allora , Queensland , Australia , is depicted through flashbacks , and is the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins . Travers idolized her loving , imaginative father , Travers Robert Goff , but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated firings , strained her parents ' marriage , and caused her distressed mother to attempt suicide . Goff died at an early age from tuberculosis when Travers was seven years old . In Los Angeles , Travers is irritated by what she perceives as the city s unreality and the inhabitants ' intrusive friendliness , personified by her limousine driver , Ralph . At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank , Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen : screenwriter Don DaGradi , and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman . She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper , a view she also holds of the jocular Disney . Travers ' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset , with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy . Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers ' disdain for fantasy , given the nature of the Mary Poppins story , as well as Travers ' own rich imagination . She particularly objects to how the character George Banks , the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins ' charge , is depicted , insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel . Gradually , they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past . The team realize Travers has valid criticisms and make changes , though she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface . Seeking to understand what troubles her , Disney invites Travers to Disneyland , which , along with her developing friendship with Ralph , the creative team s revisions to the George Banks character , and the addition of a new song and a different ending , help dissolve Travers ' opposition . Her creativity reawakens , and she begins working with the team ; however , when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence , she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home . Disney learns that Travers is actually her pen name , taken from her father s given name . Her real name is Helen Goff , and she s actually Australian , not British . This gives Disney new insight into Travers , and he follows her to London . Arriving unexpectedly at her door , Disney tells her that he also had a less-than-ideal childhood , but stresses the healing value of his art . He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present . Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights . Three years later , in 1964 , Mary Poppins is to have its world premiere at Grauman s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . Disney has not invited Travers , fearing how she might react with the press watching . Prompted by Russell , Travers shows up unannounced at Disney s office ; he reluctantly issues her an invitation . Initially , she watches Mary Poppins with a lack of enthusiasm , particularly during the animated sequences . She gradually warms to the rest of the film ; however , becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks ' personal crisis and redemption .
