Richard , a young American seeking adventure in Bangkok , meets the eccentric Daffy , who tells him of a pristine , uninhabited island in the Gulf of Thailand with a beautiful hidden beach and lagoon . Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier , but difficulties arose and he chose to leave . Daffy commits suicide , leaving Richard a map to the island . Richard convinces a young French couple , Françoise and Étienne , to accompany him to the island , and the three travel to Ko Samui . Richard meets two Americans who have heard rumors of the island , including that huge amounts of cannabis supposedly grow there . Before departing , Richard leaves them a copy of the map . En route to the island , Richard becomes infatuated with Françoise . After swimming to the island from a neighboring one , they find a large cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai farmers . Avoiding detection , they make their way across the island and are welcomed into the secret beach settlement . The community s leader , Sal , explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island . Richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else , which satisfies Sal . The trio become integrated into the largely self-sufficient and leisurely community . The relationship between Richard and Françoise becomes romantic , and Étienne says he will not stand in their way if Françoise is happier with Richard . Tensions rise between Richard and Sal s boyfriend Bugs ; when Richard gains celebrity by killing a shark , Bugs mocks him over the shark s small size . When Sal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to Ko Pha Ngan , Bugs warns him to keep his hands off her . While there they encounter the Americans Richard met in Ko Samui , who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard s map . Richard lies to Sal that he did not give them a copy , and she blackmails him into having sex with her . On their return to the island , Richard lies to Françoise about having slept with Sal . Things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community s fishermen and leaves another , Christo , severely injured . Sal refuses to compromise the community s secrecy by bringing medical help , and Christo refuses to travel to the mainland . His worsening condition affects the group s morale , so they isolate him in a tent despite Étienne s objections . When the Americans from Ko Pha Ngan turn up on the neighboring island , Sal sees that they have a copy of the map and orders Richard to observe them until they cross over , then intercept them and destroy it . She tells everyone that she and Richard had sex , which leaves Françoise angry and heartbroken . Isolated from the group , Richard begins to lose his sanity , stalking the cannabis farmers and imagining that he is conversing with the deceased Daffy . The Americans reach the island but are discovered and killed by the farmers . Shocked at witnessing their deaths , Richard tries to gather Françoise and Étienne to leave the island . Étienne refuses to leave Christo , whose leg has become gangrenous , so Richard euthanizes Christo by suffocation . Richard is captured by the farmers and brought before the community . The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice : kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay , or else they must all leave immediately . Sal pulls the trigger , but the chamber is empty . Shocked by her willingness to commit murder , the community abandons Sal , leaving the island and going their separate ways . Later , Richard receives an email from Françoise with a group photograph of the beach community in happier times .
