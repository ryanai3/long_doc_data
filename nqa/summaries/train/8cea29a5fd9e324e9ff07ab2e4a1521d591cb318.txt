Pierre Delacroix ( whose real name is Peerless Dothan ) , is an uptight , Harvard University-educated black man , working for the television network CNS . At work , he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty , a tactless , boorish white man . Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE , and use the word nigger repeatedly in conversations , he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children . Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix s scripts for television series that portray black people in positive , intelligent scenarios , dismissing them as Cosby clones . In an effort to escape his contract through being fired , Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins . Mantan : The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface , extremely racist jokes and puns , and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show . Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray , named after American artist Man Ray , and Womack â to star in the show . While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show , Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills . To Delacroix s horror , not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show , it also becomes hugely successful . As soon as the show premieres , Manray and Womack become big stars , while Delacroix , contrary to his original stated intent , defends the show as being satirical . Delacroix quickly embraces the show , his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash . Meanwhile , an underground , militant rap group called the Mau Maus , led by Hopkins ' older brother Julius , becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show . Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program s live band position , the group plans to bring the show down using violence . Eventually , Womack quits , fed up with the show and Manray s increasing ego . Manray and Hopkins grow closer , which angers Delacroix . When he attempts to sabotage their relationship , they only grow closer . Delacroix confronts Hopkins , and when she lashes back at him , he fires her . Then she shows him a videotape she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show , but he refuses to watch it . After an argument with Delacroix , Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface . He appears in front of the studio audience , who are all in blackface , during a TV taping and does his dance number in his regular clothing . The network executives immediately turn against Manray , and Dunwitty ( who is also wearing blackface ) fires him . The Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live webcast . The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed , but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing . At his office , Delacroix ( now in blackface make-up himself , mourning Manray s death ) fantasizes that the various coon-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life ; in a rage , he destroys many of the racist collectibles . The police kill all the members of The Mau Maus except for a white member known as One-Sixteenth Black , who tearfully proclaims that he is black and demands to die with the rest of his group . Furious , Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint with her brother s revolver and demands that he play her tape . As the tape plays , Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions . Then Delacroix tries to get the gun from her , but is shot in the stomach . Hopkins , horrified , flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix s own fault that he got shot . Delacroix , holding the gun in his hands to make his gunshot wound appear self-inflicted , watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor . The film concludes with a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of black characters from Hollywood films of the first half of the 20th century . After the montage , as the cameras point to Delacroix s dead body on the floor , the camera then shows Manray doing his last Mantan sequence on stage .
