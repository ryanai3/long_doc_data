Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in New York City by whatever means necessary , including a series of small-time confidence scams . One day , he is approached by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf to travel to Mongibello , in Italy , to persuade Greenleaf s errant son , Dickie , to return to the United States and join the family business . Ripley agrees , exaggerating his friendship with Dickie , a half-remembered acquaintance , in order to gain the elder Greenleaf s trust . Shortly after his arrival in Italy , Ripley meets Dickie and Dickie s friend Marge Sherwood ; although Ripley ingratiates himself with Dickie , Marge does not seem to like him very much . As Ripley and Dickie spend more time together , Marge feels left out and begins insinuating to Dickie that Ripley is gay . Dickie then unexpectedly finds Ripley in his bedroom dressed up in his clothes and imitating his mannerisms . Dickie is upset , and from this moment on Ripley senses that his wealthy friend has begun to tire of him , resenting his constant presence and growing personal dependence . Ripley has indeed become obsessed with Dickie , which is further reinforced by his desire to imitate and maintain the wealthy lifestyle Dickie has afforded him . As a gesture to Ripley , Dickie agrees to travel with him on a short holiday to Sanremo . Sensing that Dickie is about to cut him loose , Ripley finally decides to murder him and assume his identity . When the two set sail in a small rented boat , Ripley beats him to death with an oar , dumps his anchor-weighted body into the water , and scuttles the boat . Ripley assumes Dickie s identity , living off the latter s trust fund and carefully providing communications to Marge to assure her that Dickie has dumped her . Freddie Miles , an old friend of Dickie s from Dickie s same social set , encounters Ripley at what he supposes to be Dickie s apartment in Rome ; he soon suspects something is wrong . When Miles finally confronts him , Ripley kills him with an ashtray . He later disposes of the body on the outskirts of Rome , attempting to make police believe that robbers have murdered Miles . Ripley enters a cat-and-mouse game with the Italian police but manages to keep himself safe by restoring his own identity and moving to Venice . In succession , Marge , Dickie s father , and an American private detective confront Ripley , who suggests to them that Dickie was depressed and may have committed suicide . Marge stays for a while at Ripley s rented house in Venice . When she discovers Dickie s rings in Ripley s possession , she seems to be on the verge of realising the truth . Panicked , Ripley contemplates murdering Marge , but she is saved when she says that if Dickie gave his rings to Ripley , then he probably meant to kill himself . The story concludes with Ripley traveling to Greece and resigning himself to eventually getting caught . On arrival in Greece , however , he discovers that the Greenleaf family has accepted that Dickie is dead , and Ripley shall inherit Dickie s fortune according to a will forged by Ripley on Dickie s Hermes typewriter . While the book ends with Ripley happily rich , it also suggests that he may forever be dogged by paranoia . In one of the final paragraphs , he nervously envisions a group of police officers waiting to arrest him , and Highsmith leaves her protagonist wondering , ... was he going to see policemen waiting for him on every pier that he ever approached ?
