Anita Needy Lesnicki , once an insecure and bookish teenager living near Devil s Kettle , Minnesota , is now a violent mental inmate who narrates the story as a flashback while in solitary confinement . She has been friends with a selfish and popular cheerleader , Jennifer Check , since childhood , despite having little in common . One night , Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by indie rock band Low Shoulder . A suspicious fire engulfs the bar , killing several people , and Jennifer , who is in shock , agrees to leave with the band despite Needy s protests . Later that evening , Jennifer , covered in blood , appears in Needy s kitchen and proceeds to eat food from the refrigerator . Unable to digest the matter , she vomits a trail of black , spiny fluid and then leaves in a hurry as Needy calls after her . The next morning at school , Jennifer appears fine and shrugs off Needy s concerns . While the whole town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire , Jennifer seduces the school s football captain in the woods and then kills him ; his disemboweled corpse is later found . Meanwhile , the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their rumored heroism during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school s spring formal . A month later , Jennifer is beginning to look pale , and accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin , whom she brutally kills that night . While Needy and her boyfriend , Chip , have sex , Needy senses something dreadful has happened . She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer , drenched in blood . At home , she finds Jennifer in her bedroom . Jennifer kisses her , initiating a brief makeout session , and soon explains what happened after the fire : Low Shoulder took her into the woods and offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune . Although the sacrifice and greedy exchange were a success , Jennifer was not a virgin , and when lead singer Nikolai murdered her , the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body . Unbeknownst to Needy , Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and , upon hearing that no one knew he had survived , took him into the woods and ate him , rendering him her first victim . Jennifer states that she can withstand virtually any injury without pain and is rather difficult to kill . At school the following day , the town is stunned by Colin s death . Needy goes to the school library s occult section and surmises that Jennifer is a succubus ; she is weakest when she is hungry , and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance . Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance . He does not believe her and she subsequently breaks up with him in order to protect him . Chip still goes to the dance , hoping to meet with Needy , but is instead intercepted by Jennifer , who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house . Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip . Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer , hovering in the air , attacks her . She is then stabbed by a fatally injured Chip with a pool skimmer . Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die . Needy decides she must kill Jennifer for the common good . She goes to Jennifer s home and sees her , already recovered , picking out her next victims in her yearbook . Crashing through the window , Needy engages in a fight with Jennifer wielding a box cutter . Culminating with a stab to the heart , Needy finally destroys the demon and kills her . Jennifer s mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter on top of her daughter s body . Soon after , Needy is brought to an asylum . Since she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer , she has obtained some of Jennifer s supernatural powers , such as the ability to hover in the air . Set upon revenge for what was done to herself , Jennifer , and Chip , she escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying ; there , she slaughters the members , whose killings are later discovered by local authorities .
