In 2020 , the Mars I spacecraft , en route to planet Mars , is commanded by Luke Graham ( Don Cheadle ) with fellow astronauts Nicholas Willis ( Kavan Smith ) , Sergei Kirov ( Peter Outerbridge ) , and RenĂŠe CotĂŠ ( Jill Teed ) . Upon arrival , the team discovers a crystalline formation in the Cydonia region , which they suspect is an extrusion from a subsurface geothermal column of water , useful to future human colonization . After reporting this to the World Space Station , they hear a strange sound on their communications system , which they assume to be interference from their planetary rover . While they scan the formation with radar , a large vortex kills them . After the vortex subsides , a large humanoid face is exposed in the adjacent mountain . ISS having received Luke s message , a second ship is readied for a rescue mission - the Mars II containing Commander Woody Blake ( Tim Robbins ) , Co-Commander Jim McConnell ( Gary Sinise ) , and mission specialists Terri Fisher ( Connie Nielsen ) and Phil Ohlmyer ( Jerry O'Connell ) . As the ship enters Mars orbit , micrometeoroids breach the hull . During repair , the external fuel tanks are overlooked , causing a leak and later explosion . The crew then board the REMO ( Resupply Module ) orbiting Mars . Tethered to the others , Woody launches himself at the module , but he is unable to properly land on it . Terri tries to rescue Woody , who is her husband ; but , knowing she would run out of fuel before reaching him , Woody removes his helmet , killing himself to save her . When the survivors arrive on the surface of Mars , they find Luke living on the produce of a greenhouse , whereupon he reveals that the crystalline structure looks humanoid and that the noise represents a map of human DNA in XYZ coordinates , but missing a pair of chromosomes . To complete the sequence , the crew dispatches a robotic rover to reproduce the completed signal . Following the transmission , an opening appears in the side of the mountain , which Jim , Terri , and Luke enter , while Phil remains at the repaired emergency return vehicle with orders to launch , with or without them , at the agreed time . The opening seals behind them , disrupting radio communication with Phil , and a three-dimensional projection depicts the planet Mars , covered with water , being struck by a large asteroid and rendered uninhabitable . A Martian then reveals that the natives of Mars evacuated their world in spacecraft , one of which landed on Earth to create humans , who could one day land on Mars and be recognized as descendants . An invitation is offered to one astronaut to follow the Martians to their new home . Jim accepts the invitation and is launched in an oxygenated capsule , while the others return to Phil , and subsequently to Earth .
