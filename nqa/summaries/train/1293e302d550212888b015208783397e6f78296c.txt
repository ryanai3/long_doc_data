In 2174 , the human population has exceeded the carry capacity of Earth , leading humanity to build a huge interstellar ark named Elysium . Its mission is to send 60,000 people on a 123-year trip to establish a colony on an Earth-like planet named Tanis . The passengers and crew are placed in hypersleep , with a rotating crew who awake for shifts of two years each maintaining the ship throughout the journey . Eight years into the mission the ship receives a transmission from Earth in multiple languages : You re all that s left of us . Good luck , God bless , and godspeed . Some unknown time later , two members of the flight crew , Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton , are awakened from hypersleep . Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial amnesia . The ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor , which leaves them unable to enter the bridge , although they have steady power in their quarters . Bower ventures into the seemingly abandoned ship using the ventilation system with the intention of stabilising the reactor in case it goes critical . After suffering panic attacks from his claustrophobia he begins to suffer symptoms of Orbital Dysfunction Syndrome , nicknamed Pandorum , a severe psychotic illness known to appear in deep-space travellers causing delusions , paranoia , hallucinations and violence . It is known to have been the cause of the disastrous Eden ' mission , in which the captain of a large starship called the Eden became so afflicted with Pandorum that he became convinced that the flight was cursed and ejected his entire crew of 5,000 to their deaths . Bower encounters Nadia , a former geneticist and Manh , an agriculturist , and they are attacked by a group of cannibalistic pale-skinned humanoids with heightened senses of smell and strength and a seemingly tribal culture . Bower s group flees into a barricaded chamber and finds a cook named Leland , who has been awake for years , living off the water leaking into the ship , the algae it creates , and resorting to cannibalism . Meanwhile , Payton encounters a strange young man named Corporal Gallo , who claims that the ship is lost in space and that he had to kill his rotation team in self-defense because they developed Pandorum after finding out that earth mysteriously vanished . The creatures are initially assumed to be transformed passengers , but Leland invites Bower s team to dinner and shows them mural drawings depicting their true origin . According to Leland , early in the mission Gallo developed Pandorum , as did the many passengers that he then brought out of hypersleep early . Taking advantage of their mental state , Gallo then convinced these insane passengers to exile themselves to the ship s enormous cargo hold to play a cruel cat-and-mouse game of survival which involved fighting , capturing , torturing , and eating each other . Eventually Gallo went back into hypersleep , leaving the descendants of the psychotics to evolve over the course of successive generations ( accelerated by an enzyme produced in the hypersleep pod s feeding tubes ) , becoming a troglofauna species that now roams the ship , with Gallo s savage game becoming the centre of the mutated humans ' culture . Bower hopes to find his wife on the ship before the creatures do , but later his memories come back to him and he remembers that the woman he is looking for divorced him and stayed on earth , disappearing along with the rest of the planet . This reveal almost makes him give up on the mission and helps push him closer to insanity . When Bower s group finds the reactor , they also find that it is the lair for a large community of the humanoids . Bower fails to make a stealthy approach , and Manh acts as a distraction while Bower restarts the reactor , killing most of the humanoids . Leland flees , and Manh is cornered by their leader , who challenges him to single combat . He defeats the leader , but then is killed when he hesitates to slay a humanoid child afterward . With the power restored , Payton can finally access the bridge , but Gallo assaults him to prevent him going . Gallo injects Payton with a sedative , but suddenly disappears , leaving Payton holding the syringe in his own hand . It is revealed that Payton was hallucinating his younger self and that he is in fact Gallo . Gallo opens the shutters on the bridge s windows , revealing that the ship is apparently adrift in deep space with no stars visible . The revelation is the final stress that causes Bower to slip fully into Pandorum . Gallo takes advantage of Bower s mental state and tries to convince him that they must maintain the violent society that has developed on the ship rather than attempt to revive civilization , since that is what led to the overpopulation of Earth . However , what Gallo s hallucination said about the ship being lost in space was a red herring . As Nadia observes bioluminescent ocean life through the windows , and the computer displays that 923 years have elapsed since the mission launched - 800 of which the ship has spent stationary and underwater after arriving at Tanis and automatically landing itself in the ocean . Gallo attacks Bower and Nadia , and Bower suddenly hallucinates humanoids invading the bridge . In his delirium , Bower smashes a window and water pours into the ship , drowning Gallo and all the remaining humanoids . Nadia manages to snap Bower to reality , and they climb into a hypersleep pod . The flood triggers a hull breach emergency-system which automatically ejects all active pods ( theirs as well as those of surviving colonists ) to the surface . Bower and Nadia surface near a lush coastline , and witness the other pods ascending one by one . Thus begins Year One on Tanis , with 1,213 survivors from the original 60,000 humans .
