A woman is driving dangerously down a winding road , recklessly passing cars until she comes upon a slow moving Mack truck . As she goes to pass , her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction , then slammed full-force by the Mack , killing her . Meanwhile , John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital . After a series of tests at the hospital , John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne , the hospital administrator , that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live . The procedure is very expensive : $ 250,000 ( at a minimum ) , with a down payment of $ 75,000 ( 30 % ) required to get Michael s name on the organ donor list . John tells them he is insured , but after looking through his policy , they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time , his health insurance has been changed , and the new policy does not cover the surgery , which leaves John and Denise to raise $ 75,000 on their own . The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment . The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael ; Denise urges John to do something . Unwilling to let his child die , John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun , gathers eleven hostages , and sets demands : his son s name on the recipient list as soon as possible . The hostage negotiator , Lt. Frank Grimes , stands down to let John cool off . Meanwhile , John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other . They begin to understand John s situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for . One of them , Miriam , is pregnant , and her husband Steve is hoping that their first child is healthy . A young hostage , Julie , has a broken arm , and she and her boyfriend Mitch claim that a car crash caused it . Due to holes in their story , John and another hostage , Lester , conclude the two are lying and that Mitch beat up Julie . After a while , John agrees to release some hostages to have his son s name added to the list an hour afterward . He releases Steve , Miriam , and a hostage named Rosa with her baby . The Chicago Chief of Police , Gus Monroe , gives a SWAT unit permission to insert a sniper into the building via an air shaft . John is shot but ends up receiving only a minor wound , which is treated right away . After taking the shot , the sniper s leg falls through the ceiling tiles . Outraged , John pulls him out of the air shaft and beats him up . Using the bound SWAT policeman as a human shield , he steps outside to the sight of dozens of policemen pointing weapons at him and a large , supportive crowd . John demands that his son be brought to the emergency room . The police agree to his demand in exchange for the SWAT sniper . Once his son arrives , John reveals to the hostages his intention to commit suicide so his heart can be used to save his son . He persuades Dr. Turner to perform the operation , and two of his hostages bear witness to a will stating his last request . John says his last goodbyes to Michael and enters the operating room . He loads a single bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger , but the safety is on . As he prepares to end his life a second time , his wife learns about an organ donor ( which happens to be the female driver that was killed in the beginning of the movie ) who has been flown to the hospital for organ recovery . She runs to the emergency room and stops John from shooting himself , and John allows the hostages to go free . Michael is given the life-saving operation and , after watching the procedure with Denise , John is taken into police custody . Afterwards the entire ordeal becomes subject to a national debate about the quality and accessibility of insurance and healthcare . Three months later at his trial , all of the witnesses speak on his behalf . He is later acquitted of charges of attempted murder and armed criminal action but is found guilty of kidnapping . It is never revealed what his sentence for the crime will be , but his lawyer is overheard and saying that no judge will give him more than three to five ( years ) and that she will try to get it reduced to two .
