In 1969 , child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in with the world . His widowed mother Elaine â who has led him to believe he is 12 years old , until Williams older sister , Anita , tells their mother to tell the truth , his age is actually 11 , from being placed into First Grade at the age of 5 , and skipped 5th grade . Their mother strictly controls and protects him and his older sister Anita , forbidding rock music and other unwelcome influences , driving Anita to leave home and become a flight attendant . In 1973 , 15-year-old William , influenced by the rock albums left by his sister , aspires to be a rock journalist , writing freelance articles for underground papers in San Diego . Rock journalist Lester Bangs , impressed with his writing , gives him a $ 35 assignment to review a Black Sabbath concert . He ca n't get backstage , but opening band Stillwater arrives , and after he flatters them with critical praise they bring him along . Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him , partly because of William s new friendship with veteran groupie Penny Lane , though she prefers the term Band-Aid . Feigning retirement from her glory days , she takes William under her wing , but only to get close to Russell , for whom she has genuine feelings . William is contacted by Ben Fong-Torres , editor of Rolling Stone , who believes him to be older and hires him to write a story . He convinces Ben to let him write about Stillwater , and he is instructed to go on the road with them . Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe are evident . William begins to interview the members of the band , but Russell repeatedly puts it off . Penny watches the interaction and sympathizes with William , whom they joking call the enemy because he s a journalist , but he quickly becomes part of their inner circle as he loses his objectivity . The band experiences problems with promoters and venues on the tour , and hires Dennis , a professional manager . Penny is told she must leave them before New York , where Russell s ex-wife/girlfriend Leslie will join them . Stillwater loses Penny s three protĂŠgĂŠ groupies to another band in a poker game ; she acts nonchalant but is devastated . Also , Dennis has chartered a small plane to allow them to play more gigs than their tour bus does , and there is no room on it for Penny , who is left behind . However , Penny goes to New York on her own , and shows up at the restaurant where the band is celebrating the news that they will be featured on the cover of Rolling Stone . Leslie notices her apparent attempts to get Russell s attention , and Penny is asked to leave . William chases her back to her hotel , where he saves her from overdosing on quaaludes . The next day , the band flies to another gig , but the plane encounters severe weather . Believing they are about to die , members of the group confess their secrets to one another , bringing the conflicts between Jeff and Russell into the open . Jeff insults Penny , but William defends her and confesses that he loves her . The plane lands safely , leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere . William leaves the group , to finish the article at the Rolling Stone office in San Francisco , writing the whole truth about what he has observed . Fearful the story will damage the band s image , Russell tells the magazine s fact-checker that the boy s story is untrue , killing the article and crushing William emotionally . William s sister happens to encounter him sitting dejected in the airport , and offers to take him anywhere in the world ; he chooses to go home to San Diego , where their mother is overcome to have them back . One of the groupies chastises Russell for what he did to William . Russell calls Penny and asks to meet with her , but she tricks him , giving him William s home address instead . He is forced to face William and apologizes ; William finally gets his interview , and Russell reverses himself and confirms William s article to Rolling Stone , which runs it as a cover feature . Meanwhile , Penny purchases a ticket to Morocco , fulfilling her long-standing fantasy .
