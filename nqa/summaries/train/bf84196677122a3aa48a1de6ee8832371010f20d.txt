George meets Ira at a small comedy club and hires him as his assistant . Ira becomes one of George s only close relationships . The two travel around the country , George hires Ira as his personal assistant and joke writer and opens for him in the big comedy clubs , often meeting with real life comedians who play themselves and talk about the business of comedy .
