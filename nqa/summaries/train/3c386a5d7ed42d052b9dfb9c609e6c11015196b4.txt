In 1901 , the family of nine-year-old Vito Andolini is killed in Corleone , Sicily , after his father insults local Mafia chieftain Don Ciccio . Vito escapes to New York City and is registered as Vito Corleone on Ellis Island . In 1958 , during his son s First Communion party at Lake Tahoe , Michael Corleone has a series of meetings in his role as the Don of his crime family . Corleone caporegime Frank Pentangeli is dismayed that Michael will not help him defend his Brooklyn territory against the Rosato brothers , who work for Michael s business partner Hyman Roth . That night , Michael leaves Nevada after surviving an assassination attempt at his home . In 1917 , Vito Corleone lives in New York with his wife Carmela and son Sonny . He loses his job due to the nepotism of local extortionist Don Fanucci ; he is subsequently invited to a burglary by his neighbor Peter Clemenza . Michael suspects Roth of planning the assassination , but meets with him in Miami and feigns ignorance . In New York , Pentangeli attempts to maintain Michael s faĂ§ade by making peace with the Rosatos , but they attempt to kill him . Roth , Michael , and several of their partners travel to Havana to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of Fulgencio Batista ; Michael becomes reluctant after reconsidering the viability of the ongoing Cuban Revolution . On New Year s Eve , he tries to have Roth and Roth s right-hand man Johnny Ola killed , but Roth survives when Michael s bodyguard is discovered and shot by police . Michael accuses his brother Fredo of betrayal after Fredo inadvertently reveals that he d met with Ola previously . Batista abruptly abdicates due to rebel advances ; during the ensuing chaos , Michael , Fredo , and Roth separately escape to the United States . Back home , Michael learns that his wife Kay has miscarried . Three years later , Vito and Carmela have had two more sons , Fredo and Michael . Vito s criminal conduct attracts the attention of Fanucci , who extorts him . His partners , Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio , wish to avoid trouble by paying in full , but Vito insists that he can convince Fanucci to accept a smaller payment by making him an offer he wo n't refuse . During a neighborhood festa , he stalks Fanucci to his apartment and shoots him dead . In Washington , D.C. , a Senate committee on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family . Having survived the earlier attempt on his life , Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael , who he believes had double-crossed him , and is placed under witness protection . Now a respected figure in his community , Vito is approached for help by a widow who is being evicted . After an unsuccessful negotiation with Vito , the widow s landlord asks around , learns of Vito s reputation , and hastily agrees to let the widow stay on terms very favorable to her . In the meantime , Vito and his partners are becoming more and more successful , with the establishment of their business , Genco Pura Olive Oil . Fredo is returned to Nevada , where he privately explains himself to Michael : resentful at being passed over to head the family , he helped Roth in expectation of something in returnâunaware , he claims , of the plot on Michael s life . Michael responds by disowning Fredo . Unable to get to the heavily-guarded Pentangeli , Michael instead brings Pentangeli s Sicilian brother to the hearing . On seeing his brother , Pentangeli denies his previous statements , and the hearing dissolves in an uproar . Afterwards , Kay reveals to Michael that her miscarriage was actually an abortion , and that she intends to take their children away from Michael s criminal life . Outraged , Michael takes custody of the children and banishes Kay from the family . Vito visits Sicily for the first time since emigrating . He and business partner Tommasino are admitted to Don Ciccio s compound , ostensibly to ask for Ciccio s blessing on their olive oil business . Vito exacts his childhood vengeance by knifing Ciccio after revealing his old identity , but Tommasino is shot in the leg and suffers a permanent disability during their escape . Carmela Corleone dies . At the funeral , Michael appears to forgive Fredo but later orders caporegime Al Neri to assassinate him out on the lake . Roth is refused asylum and even entry to Israel and is forced to return to the United States . Over the dissent of consigliere Tom Hagen , Michael sends caporegime Rocco Lampone to intercept and shoot Roth on arrival . Rocco , however , is shot dead by federal agents after completing his mission . At the witness protection compound , Hagen reminds Pentangeli that failed plotters against the Roman Emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for . Pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub . On December 7 , 1941 , the Corleone family gathers in their dining room to surprise Vito for his birthday . Michael announces that , in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor , he has left college and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps , leaving Sonny furious , Hagen incredulous , and Fredo the only brother supportive . When Vito arrives , everyone leaves the room to greet him , leaving Michael alone at the table . Michael sits alone by the lake at the family compound .
