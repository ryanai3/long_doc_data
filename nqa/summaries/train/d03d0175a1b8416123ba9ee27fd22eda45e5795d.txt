Once there , he took off all his clothes and then passed out . Emma leads Adam to her bedroom to retrieve his missing pants and they end up having sex . The two have sex again at Adam’s house and before she leaves Adam agrees to her proposal for a casual relationship ( as she puts it , using each other for sex and nothing else ) .

At first things go well , but Adam becomes jealous when Sam ( Ben Lawson ) —another resident—seeks her attention .

Meanwhile , Emma is depressed over not being with Adam . The situation is compounded and complicated by her younger sister Katie s ( Olivia Thirlby ) wedding the next day and her widowed mother ( Talia Balsam ) arriving for the event with a male companion ( Brian Dierker ) of her own . Emma feels she is being strong for her mom by not letting herself get too close to anyone so she wo n't become upset by seeing Emma get hurt if a relationship ends poorly .

A nervous Emma phones Adam and tells him that she misses him . He responds that they were never really together .

Adam goes in to visit Alvin who surprisingly gives him some tender advice about falling in love . Shira tells Emma about Adam s dad being admitted to the hospital . As Adam leaves the building he calls Emma and tells her that she must be present if she is going to say that she misses him .

She tells Adam that she is sorry she hurt him and confesses that she really loves and cares about him and they reconcile . After eating breakfast together the next morning—something that never happened before—they arrive in Santa Barbara just before Katie s wedding is starting .
