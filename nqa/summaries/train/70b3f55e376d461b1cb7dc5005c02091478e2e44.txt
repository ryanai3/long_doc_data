William Will Thacker owns an independent book store , The Travel Book Co. in Notting Hill . He is divorced and shares his house with an eccentric , care-free Welshman named Spike . Will encounters Hollywood superstar Anna Scott when she enters his shop . Minutes later , they collide in the street and his drink spills on her clothes . Will offers his house nearby for Anna to change . Before leaving , she impulsively kisses him . Days later , Anna leaves him a message that she is at the Ritz Hotel . Will is mistaken for a journalistâin a panic he claims he works for Horse & Hound , and is made to interview the cast of Anna s new sci-fi film , which he has not seen . Anna calls him back in and says she has cleared her evening for him . Will is exhilarated , before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey s birthday party ; Anna surprises him by saying she will join him . At the house of Max and Bella , Anna feels at home as she share stories with the small group of birthday party guests . She and Will share a moment in a private garden square . The next day they go to a restaurant , where Will overhears Anna being spoken of in salacious terms and defends her . Anna invites Will to her room at the Ritz , but her American boyfriend , film star Jeff King , has arrived unannounced . Will pretends to be a room-service waiter and Jeff is very dismissive towards him . Anna is apologetic and embarrassed ; she thought King had broken up with her . Will realizes he must end things with Anna . Over the next six months , Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates ( the last with someone who is perfect , absolutely perfect ) , hoping to help him move on from Anna . A distraught Anna appears unexpectedly at Will s doorstep ; some pre-stardom nude photos have been published , and she needs a place to hide out . Once she calms down , they spend some time on the rooftop patio rehearsing lines from Anna s next film . Back inside , when she sees a poster of the Marc Chagall painting La MariĂŠe , Anna tells Will that it feels like how love should be . After an amazing day together , Anna goes to him at night and they make love . The next morning , she makes him breakfast in bed and she asks if she can stay . The doorbell rings and they are horrified to find a horde of reporters , alerted by Spike s careless talk at the pub . Spike re-opens the door to be photographed in only his dirty underwear , exacerbating the situation . While Anna gets dressed , she verbally berates Will for what she views as his desire for publicity . He tries to cheer her up , reminding her that the fame is all nonsense , but she tells him the scandal will follow her forever , departing with the statement that she regrets their time together . Several months and seasons pass . At a dinner with his friends , Will discovers that Anna is back in town to make a Henry James film , which Will had previously suggested to her . He visits her location shoot , where Anna sees him and invites him past security . Given headphones to hear the dialogue , Will leaves when he overhears Anna evading questions from her co-star , stating that Will is no one important . The next day , Anna comes to the bookshop with a present . Anna admits she still has feelings for him , apologises for her behaviour months ago and explains that she now understands his comment , months earlier , that the fame is nonsense . She says she has to leave tomorrow and is wondering if she did not leave , whether he might let her see him a little , or maybe a lot , whether he could like her again after how badly she treated him . When he brings up the conversation she had with her costar on the set she explains that her costar is a notorious gossiper and she was being discreet . Will turns her down , saying he is unable to handle another inevitable break up , especially considering how big of a star she is and that he would be unable to escape seeing her face if the inevitable breakup happens . He says he is from Notting Hill and she from Beverly Hills . She says with teary eyes , I m also just a girl , standing in front of a boy , asking him to love her . She kisses him goodbye and leaves . She leaves Will s present behind , which turns out to be the original La MariĂŠe . Will meets his friends in a restaurant . They take turns supporting his decision to not see her any more and try to make him feel better . Spike enters the restaurant and is told that Will has decided to leave Anna . Spike calls him a daft prick and lambastes him for turning away the woman he loves . His friends race him across London in Max s car to reach her press conference at the Savoy Hotel . Will adopts his Horse & Hound persona to ask two questions that reveal their relationship and his feelings for her , persuading her to stay in the UK indefinitely . She breaks into a dazzling smile . His friends in the audience hug and kiss . A montage shows the two getting married , at one of Anna s movie premieres , then happily sitting on a garden square bench , where Will reads to a heavily pregnant Anna .
