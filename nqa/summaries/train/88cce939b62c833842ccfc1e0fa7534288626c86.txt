Jack blames her co-worker , Louis Dainard ( Ron Eldard ) , as she was covering his shift while he recovered from a hangover , and all Joe has left is a locket that belonged to her , that he now holds on to . Four months later , Joe s best friend Charles Kaznyk ( Riley Griffiths ) decides to make a low-budget zombie movie for an international film competition . Charles enlists the help of Preston Scott ( Zach Mills ) , Martin Read ( Gabriel Basso ) , and Cary McCarthy ( Ryan Lee ) , as well as Dainard s daughter , Alice ( Elle Fanning ) . Though their fathers would be furious , Joe and Alice become infatuated with each other . Charles has them film a scene at a train depot at midnight . While they are rehearsing , a train approaches , and Charles has them start filming as the train passes to add production value ' . While filming , Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train , causing a massive derailment that destroys the train , the depot and the surrounding area , and the friends barely survive . The children investigate the wreck and find crates full of strange white cubes , then discover the truck s driver is Dr. Woodward ( Glynn Turman ) , their biology teacher . Woodward , barely alive , warns them at gunpoint to forget what they saw that night , or else they and their parents will be killed . The children flee the scene just as a convoy from the local U.S. Air Force base , led by Col. Nelec ( Noah Emmerich ) , arrive at the scene . Nelec discovers an empty Super 8mm film box , and assumes the event was purposely captured on camera . While Joe and Charles wait for their film to be developed , the town experiences strange events : All the dogs run away , several townspeople go missing , the electrical power fluctuates and electronic items from all over are stolen . Overhearing military communications , Jack approaches Nelec to address the rising panic in town , but Nelec instead orders him arrested . Nelec orders the use of flamethrowers to start wildfires outside of town , as an excuse to evacuate people to the base . Suddenly , soldiers sweep into town to begin the evacuation . Meanwhile , Joe and Charles watch the derailment footage and discover that a large creature escaped from the train . At the base , Joe learns from Alice s father that she is missing , abducted by the creature . Joe , Charles , Martin , and Cary convince Jen , Charles ' older sister , to pretend to hit on Donny ( a worker at the camera shop ) in order to get into town to rescue Alice . They break into Dr. Woodward s storage trailer and discover films and documents from his time as a government researcher . They play the film , which reveals that an alien crash-landed in 1958 . The Air Force captured the alien and was running experiments on it while keeping it from its ship . Woodward was one of the scientists experimenting on the ship , composed of the white cubes . At one point , the alien grabbed Woodward , apparently establishing a psychic connection with him . Now understanding the alien , he was compelled to rescue it and help it escape from Earth . He found out about the train , years later , and sought the opportunity to help the creature . The boys are caught by Nelec , but as they are taken back to base , the alien attacks their bus . The airmen are killed and the boys escape . Meanwhile , Jack escapes from the base s brig and makes his way to the shelter housing the townsfolk . He learns from Preston about Joe s plan to rescue Alice . Jack and Dainard then agree to put aside their differences to save their kids , making amends along the way . In town , their hardware malfunctions as the military attempts to kill the alien . Martin is injured in an explosion , so Charles stays behind with him while Joe and Cary head to the cemetery , where Joe had earlier seen something there that made him suspicious . Inside the cemetery s garage , they find a massive tunnel leading to a warren of underground caverns . In a chamber beneath the town s water tower , they find the alien has created a device from the town s stolen electronics , that it appears to be trying to fully activate , attached to the base of the tower . The alien also has several people , including Alice , hanging from the ceiling and unconscious , that it uses for food . Using Cary s firecrackers as a distraction , Joe frees Alice and the others , but they end up trapped in a dead end cavern after the alien chases them down and eats the others . Alice and Cary scream and cower against the tunnel wall , but Joe steps forward and tries to talk to the alien . The alien grabs Joe , who quietly speaks to the alien , telling him over and over that bad things happen but that the alien can still live . After studying Joe for a moment , and then hearing its device fully activating , the alien releases him and departs , allowing the three to return to the surface . As Joe and Alice reunite with their fathers , everyone watches as various metal objects from all over town are magnetically pulled to the top of the water tower . The white cubes are also pulled in to assemble into the alien s spaceship , using the objects and the water tower as its base . As it nears completion , the alien enters the spaceship . The locket is then drawn from Joe s pocket towards the tower and Joe , after a brief moment , decides to let it go , completing the ship . The water tank implodes and as the tower legs fall a safe distance away into the street , the ship rockets into space . Joe takes Alice s hand as they watch the ship depart into the night sky . During the credits , the kids ' completed film , entitled The Case , is shown .
