Years after a zombie apocalypse , survivors have set up outposts across the United States . One outpost in the city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , contains a feudal-like government . Bordered on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electric fence , the city has become a sanctuary . The rich and powerful live in a luxury high-rise called Fiddler s Green , while the rest of the population subsists in squalor . Paul Kaufman ( Dennis Hopper ) , the city s ruthless ruler , has sponsored Dead Reckoning , an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the zombie-infested areas with ease . Riley Denbo ( Simon Baker ) is the designer and commander of Dead Reckoning . Unlike Kaufman , Riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens , as well as providing them with food and medical supplies . Using Dead Reckoning , Riley and his crew ventured into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for supplies . On these mission , they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior . One such zombie is Big Daddy ( Eugene Clark ) , formerly a gas station owner . After the mission , Riley retires from commanding Dead Reckoning . Back to the city , he gets to Chihuahua ( Phil Fondacaro ) s bar . There , he sees a hooker named Slack ( Asia Argento ) being forced in a cage with some zombies to entertain guests . Riley and Charlie ( Robert Joy ) save Slack ; Charlie kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos . Riley , Charlie and Slack are arrested . Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution , for helping Mulligan ( Bruce McFee ) to instigate rebellion among the poor . Meanwhile , Cholo DeMora ( John Leguizamo ) , Dead Reckoning s second in command , is denied an apartment in Fiddler s Green despite his service to Kaufman . In retaliation , Cholo takes over Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler s Green with it . Kaufman approaches Riley and tasks him , as well as Charlie and Slack , to retrieve Dead Reckoning . They are supervised by Manolete ( Sasha Roiz ) , Motown ( Krista Bridges ) , and Pillsbury ( Pedro Miguel Arce ) . On the way , Manolete is bitten and then killed by Slack . After catching up with Dead Reckoning , Riley approaches the vehicle alone . Charlie , Slack , and Pillsbury follow him after subduing Motown and leaving her behind . Realising Riley is working for Kaufman , Cholo holds both Riley and Charlie at gunpoint . As he prepares to fire Dead Reckoning s missiles at Fiddler s Green , Riley uses a small device and deactivates Dead Reckoning s weapons systems ; he then destroys the device . Motown , who had regained consciousness , opens fire and nearly kills both Riley and Cholo ( who is maimed by one of the gunshots ) . She is bitten by a zombie and killed by Slack . Riley convinces Cholo to allow him escape North and to join him , but the latter decides to head back to Fiddler s Green to deal with Kaufman ; his partner , Foxy ( Tony Nappo ) accompanies him . While en route , Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman by himself . Riley takes over Dead Reckoning once again and returns to Fiddler s Green . Elsewhere , Big Daddy ( who had gathered a large group of zombies ) learns that they can walk safely underwater . He leads the zombies to cross the river to the human city . They take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people . As a result of the zombies making it into the city , the electric fences that once kept the zombies out have now become a wall to trap them and the humans inside . Seeing the city overrun , Kaufman runs with his money , and encounters a zombified Cholo in the parking garage . As the two struggle , Big Daddy kills both with a propane tank . Riley s group arrives at the city only to come upon a drawbridge having already been drawn . Riley leaves to bring the bridge down , but a small group of zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning . Riley and the others manage to dispose and evade the zombies . After crossing the bridge , they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies . Realizing it is too late to save them , they mercy kill them with missiles . It is then revealed that most of the poor people were lead to safety by Mulligan , thus surviving the assault . Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups . As they see Big Daddy and the zombies , who are , curiously , not attacking the surviving humans , leaving the city , Riley decides to leave them alone . While lighting up the rest of the fireworks ( which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless ) , Riley s group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning .
