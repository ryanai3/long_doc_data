Dominick Dom Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) and Arthur ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) are extractors , who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract valuable information through a shared dream world . Their latest target , Japanese businessman Saito ( Ken Watanabe ) , reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly-impossible job : planting an idea in a person s subconscious , or inception . To break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer ( Pete Postlethwaite ) , Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer s son and heir , Robert ( Cillian Murphy ) , to dissolve his father s company . In return , Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge , allowing Cobb to return home to his children . Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team : Eames ( Tom Hardy ) , a conman and identity forger ; Yusuf ( Dileep Rao ) , a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable dream within a dream strategy ; and Ariadne ( Ellen Page ) , an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes , recruited with the help of Cobb s father-in-law , Professor Stephen Miles ( Michael Caine ) . While dream-sharing with Cobb , Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal ( Marion Cotillard ) . When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney , Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles , which the team ( including Saito , who wants to verify their success ) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream . At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a kick that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which proceeds much faster in each successive level . The first level is Yusuf s dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer s subconscious , which has been trained to defend against extraction . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into limbo , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is difficult and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission . Eames impersonates Fischer s godfather , Peter Browning ( Tom Berenger ) , to suggest Fischer reconsider his father s will . Yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level . In the second level , a hotel dreamed by Arthur , Cobb convinces Fischer that he has been kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his subconscious protector . Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning s subconscious ( in reality , it is a ruse to enter Fischer s ) . The third level is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames . The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious . Yusuf , under pursuit by Fischer s projections in the first level , deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon . This removes the gravity of Arthur s level , forcing him to improvise a new kick that will synchronize with the van hitting the water , and causes an avalanche in Eames ' level . Mal s projection emerges and kills Fischer , Cobb kills Mal , and Saito succumbs to his wounds ; all three fall into Limbo . While Eames sets up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives , Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito . Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology . Sedated for a few hours of real time , they spent fifty years in dream time constructing a world from their shared memories . When Mal refused to return to reality , Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem ( an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality ) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real . However , when she woke up , Mal was still convinced that she was dreaming . In an attempt to wake up for real , Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same . Facing a murder charge , Cobb fled the U.S. , leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles . Through his confession , Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal s death . Ariadne kills Mal s projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick . Revived at the mountain fortress , Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea : a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man . While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito , the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality . Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement . The dreamers all awaken on the plane and Saito makes a phone call . Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport , Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home . Cobb tests reality using his totem , a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world , but ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden .
