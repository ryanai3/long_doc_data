In September 1965 , on the fictional New England island called New Penzance , 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe , a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scoutmaster Randy Ward . Suzy Bishop , also 12 , lives on the island with her parents , Walt and Laura , both attorneys , and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer s End . Sam and Suzy , both introverted , intelligent and mature for their age , met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye s Fludde and have been pen pals since then . Their relationship having become romantic over the course of their correspondence , they have made a secret pact to reunite and run away together . Sam brings camping equipment , and Suzy brings her binoculars , six books , her kitten , and her brother s battery-powered record player . They hike , camp and fish together in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island . They are confronted by a group of Khaki Scouts who try to capture them , and during the resulting altercation , Suzy injures the Scouts ' de facto leader , Redford , with her scissors and Camp Ivanhoe s dog is killed by a stray shot from a bow and arrow wielded by one of the Scouts . The Scouts flee and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove which they name Moonrise Kingdom . They set up camp and go swimming . Later , while drying off , they begin dancing to FranĂ§oise Hardy in their underwear . As the romantic tension between them grows , they kiss repeatedly . Suzy s parents , Scoutmaster Ward , the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe , and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp find Sam and Suzy in their tent at the cove . Suzy s parents take her home and when Sharp contacts the foster parents he is told that they no longer wish to house Sam . He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of Social Services â an otherwise nameless woman with plans to place Sam in a juvenile refuge and to explore the possibility of treating him with electroshock therapy . The Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help the couple . Together , they paddle to a fictional neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben , an older relative of one of the Scouts . Ben works at Fort Lebanon , a larger Khaki Scout summer camp located on St. Jack Wood Island and run by Commander Pierce , who is Ward s boss and views Ward as incompetent . Ben decides that the best available option is to try to get Sam and Suzy aboard a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services , but before leaving he performs a wedding ceremony , which he admits is not legally binding . Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat , and instead are pursued by Suzy s parents , Captain Sharp , Social Services and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scoutmaster Ward , who displays great leadership after Commander Pierce is incapacitated . A violent hurricane and flash flood strike only three days after Sam and Suzy first ran away from home and , after many twists and turns , Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met . The steeple is destroyed by lightning , but everyone survives . During the storm , Sharp decides to become Sam s legal guardian , thus saving Sam from the orphanage , as well as allowing him to remain on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy . At Summer s End , Sam is painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom . Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner . On slipping out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car , Sam tells Suzy that he will see her the following day .
