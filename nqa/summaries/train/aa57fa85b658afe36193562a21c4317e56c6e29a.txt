After stealing an 86-carat ( 17.2Ã‚ g ) diamond in a heist in Antwerp , Franky Four-Fingers goes to London to see diamond dealer Doug The Head on behalf of New York jeweler Cousin Avi . One of the other robbers advises Franky to obtain a gun from ex-KGB agent Boris The Blade . Unbeknownst to Franky , Boris and the robber are brothers and plan to steal the diamond from him before he can turn it over to Doug . Meanwhile , boxing promoter and slot machine shop owner Turkish convinces gangster Brick Top to put boxer Gorgeous George in a matchup against one of Brick Top s boxers . However , when Turkish sends his partner Tommy and Gorgeous George to purchase a caravan from a group of Irish Travellers , George gets into a fight with Mickey O'Neil , a bare-knuckle boxing champion who badly injures George . Turkish convinces Mickey to replace George in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey s mother . Brick Top agrees to the change on the condition that Mickey throws the fight in the fourth round . Boris gives Franky a revolver in exchange for a favour : Franky is to place a bet on Boris ' behalf at Brick Top s bookies . Avi , knowing Franky has a gambling problem , flies to London with his bodyguard Rosebud to claim the diamond personally . Boris hires Vinny and Sol , two small-time crooks , to rob Franky while he is at the bookies . The robbery goes awry and Sol , Vinny , and their driver Tyrone are caught on-camera , but manage to kidnap Franky . Instead of throwing the fight , Mickey knocks his opponent out with a single punch . Infuriated , Brick Top robs Turkish of his savings and demands that Mickey fight again , and lose this time . Meanwhile , Boris retrieves the diamond and murders Franky with a pistol . Brick Top tracks down Sol , Vinny , Tyrone , and their friend , Yardie Bad Boy Lincoln and plans on killing them for robbing his bookies . Sol bargains for their lives by promising Brick Top the stolen diamond , and is given 48 hours to retrieve it . Avi and Doug hire Bullet-Tooth Tony to help them find Franky . When the trail leads to Boris , they kidnap him and retrieve the diamond , closely pursued by Sol , Vinny , and Tyrone . Coincidentally Turkish and Tommy are driving on the same stretch of road at the time . When Tommy throws Turkish s carton of milk out of their car window ; it splashes over Tony s windscreen , causing him to crash and killing Rosebud in the process . Boris escapes from the wreck only to be hit by Tyrone s car . Tony and Avi are confronted by Sol , Vinny , and Tyrone at a pub where Tony realizes that the trio s pistols are replicas , which he contrasts with his real handgun and intimidates them into leaving . The wounded Boris arrives with an assault rifle with a grenade launcher looking for the diamond back but is shot and killed by Tony , wounding Tyrone at the same time . Sol and Vinny leave a wounded Tyrone and escape with the diamond , which Vinny hides in his pants . When Tony catches up to them , they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop . Once there , they produce the diamond , but it is promptly swallowed by a dog that Vinny got from the travelers . Avi fires at the fleeing dog , accidentally killing Tony . He gives up and returns to New York . Mickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys a better caravan for his mother , but Turkish has no money left since Brick Top stole his savings . Furious , Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish s gambling arcade and burn down Mickey s mother s caravan while she is asleep inside . Mickey agrees to fight to avoid more carnage , but gets so drunk after his mother s wake that Turkish fears he will not make it to the fourth round . If he fails to go down as agreed , Brick Top s men will execute Turkish , Tommy , Mickey , and the entire campsite of travelers . Mickey makes it to the fourth round , when he suddenly knocks out his opponent . Outside the arena , Brick Top and his men are killed by the travelers . Mickey has bet on himself to win , and waited until the fourth round to allow the travelers time to ambush and kill Brick Top s men at the campsite . The next morning , Turkish and Tommy find the travelers campsite deserted . When confronted by the police , they can not explain why they are there , until Vinny s dog suddenly arrives and they claim to be walking it . Sol and Vinny are arrested when the police find Franky and Tony s bodies in their car . Turkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a squeaky toy that it had swallowed , and discover the diamond in its stomach , as well . They consult Doug about selling the diamond and he calls Avi , who returns to London .
