Ethan Hunt is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich to enter the United States , only to kill him in a subsequent plane crash . Nekhorvich , an old friend of Ethan , had forewarned the IMF of his arrival , planning to deliver to them a new bioweapon , Chimera , and its cure , Bellerophon . He was forced to develop these by Biocyte Pharmaceuticals . IMF determines that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose is responsible . IMF assigns Ethan to recover the virus and its cure . It also insists that he recruits Nyah Nordoff-Hall , a professional thief presently operating in Seville , Spain . Later , Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose s ex-girlfriend . After recruiting Nyah , Ethan assembles his team , computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird , in Sydney , Australia , where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying . As Ethan stakes out Biocyte , Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to learn about the Chimera virus . At a horse racing event , Ambrose meets with Biocyte s CEO , John C. McCloy . He shows McCloy a video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich s colleagues . He then blackmails McCloy into cooperating with him . Nyah steals video footage and transfers it to Ethan . Ethan s team learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim s red blood cells . Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window . The IMF team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon . However , they learn that the only samples of Bellerophon were taken by Nekhorvich , and are now in Ambrose s hands . Ambrose has the cure , but does not have the virus ( which Nekhorvich injected himself with ) . As a result , Ambrose forced McCloy to exchange a sample of the virus for a sample of Bellerophon . The team break into Biocyte to destroy the virus . Ambrose , posing as Ethan , tricks Nyah into revealing his plan . Ambrose captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus . Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of the virus before Ambrose intervenes , and a firefight ensues . Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the last sample of Chimera . She injects herself with it , preventing Ambrose from simply killing her to get it . Ambrose takes Nyah away , and Ethan escapes from the laboratory . Ambrose lets Nyah wander the streets of Sydney in a daze , intending to start a pandemic . He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options , to make him the majority shareholder . He predicts that the price of Biocyte s stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak . Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon . While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose , Luther and Billy locate Nyah , who has wandered to a cliff side , intent on killing herself to prevent Chimera from spreading . Ethan eventually gains the upper hand over Ambrose and kills him . With little time left on the 20-hour countdown , Luther reaches Ethan , takes Bellerophon and injects Nyah with it . IMF clears Nyah s criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney .
