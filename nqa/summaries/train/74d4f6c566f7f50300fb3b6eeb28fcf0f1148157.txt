Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is upset by his team s loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason . With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon , Jason Giambi , and Jason Isringhausen to free agency , Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002 , but must overcome Oakland s limited payroll . During a visit to the Cleveland Indians , Beane meets Peter Brand , a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players ' value . Beane tests Brand s theory by asking whether he would have drafted him ( out of high school ) , Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager . Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal prospect , his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing . After some prodding , Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and surmised that Beane would probably have accepted a scholarship to Stanford instead . Impressed , Beane hires the inexperienced Brand to be the Athletics assistant general manager . Oakland team scouts are first dismissive and then hostile towards Brand s non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players . Most notably , Grady Fuson aggressively confronts Beane , causing him to be fired . Grady then takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team s future . Rather than relying on the scouts ' experience and intuition , Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on-base percentage ( OBP ) . Beane signs the ones Brand suggests , such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford , past-his-prime outfielder David Justice , and injured Scott Hatteberg . Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe , the Athletics ' manager , who does not agree with the new philosophy . With tensions already high between the two due to a contract dispute , Howe disregards Beane s and Brand s strategy and plays a lineup he prefers . Early in the season , the Athletics fare poorly , leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure . Beane convinces the owner to stay the course . He trades away the lone traditional first baseman , Carlos PeĂąa , to force Howe to use Hatteberg at that position , threatening to make similar deals if Howe wo n't cooperate . The A s win 19 consecutive games , tying for the longest winning streak in American League history . Beane s young daughter implores him to go to a game against the Kansas City Royals , where Oakland is already leading 11â0 after the third inning and appears set to win a record-breaking 20th game in a row . Like many baseball players , Beane is superstitious and avoids games in progress , but upon hearing how well the game is going on the radio , he decides to go . Beane arrives in the fourth inning , only to watch the team falter and eventually allow the Royals to even the score at 11 . Finally , the A s do win , on a walk-off home run by Hatteberg . After celebrating that , however , the A s again lose in the postseason , this time to the Minnesota Twins . Beane is disappointed , believing nothing short of a championship should be considered a success . He is contacted by the owner of the Boston Red Sox , who realizes that the sabermetric model is the future of baseball . Beane declines an opportunity to be GM of the Red Sox , despite the $ 12.5 million salary , which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in sports history . He returns to Oakland , while an epilogue reveals that two years later , the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series , using the model pioneered by the Athletics .
