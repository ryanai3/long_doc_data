Chev Chelios ( Jason Statham ) is a Los Angeles-based British hitman , working for a crime syndicate headed by Carlito ( Carlos Sanz ) . Chelios is contracted by Carlito to kill mafia boss Don Kim ( Keone Young ) as members of the Triads have been encroaching on Carlito s business . Chelios goes to Don Kim and apparently murders him . However , Ricky Verona ( Jose Pablo Cantillo ) , an ambitious small-time criminal uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios ; Verona will kill Chelios so the Triads do not retaliate , and then take Chelios s place as Carlito s new hired gun . The morning after Don Kim s death , while Chelios sleeps in his apartment , Verona , his brother Alex ( Jay Xcala ) , and several henchmen break in and inject Chelios with a Chinese synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline , slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim . Chelios wakes to find a recording left by Verona showing what he has done . In anger , Chelios smashes his TV and heads out . Chelios phones Mafia surgeon Doc Miles ( Dwight Yoakam ) , who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger , and he is unsure if the antidote exists . Chelios keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters , taking illegal drugs and synthetic epinephrine , fighting with police , stealing a police officer s motorcycle , having public sex with his girlfriend Eve ( Amy Smart ) , and driving his car through a shopping mall . Chelios visits Carlito at his penthouse and asks him to help find an antidote , as well as to find and kill Verona and his crew . Carlito says there is no antidote and only confirms that Carlito and Verona are working together . Carlito tells Chelios how he will use his death as a scapegoat against the Chinese . An angered Chelios leaves Carlito s penthouse to find Verona . Through Chelios ' street contact , a transvestite named Kaylo ( Efren Ramirez ) , he finds Alex at a restaurant and unsuccessfully interrogates him about his brother s whereabouts before killing him . Chelios phones Verona through Alex s phone and tells him of his brother s death , prompting Verona to send thugs after Eve as a revenge . Chelios rushes to pick up Eve before Verona s thugs get to her . Chelios reveals his true profession to her and that he was planning to retire to spend more time with her . Kaylo , who has been kidnapped by Carlito s men , is forced to call Chelios and tell him that Verona is at a Triad warehouse . Chelios goes there , finding Kaylo s corpse and the henchmen . They reveal that Carlito ordered them to kill Chelios . Eve , who has followed Chelios , unexpectedly arrives , but then escapes with Chelios after a shootout with Carlito s henchmen . Chelios and Eve go to Doc Miles s place , where Miles explains that he can not cure Chelios . Knowing that he will die soon , Chelios decides to take his revenge on Verona and arranges a meeting with him at a downtown hotel . Chelios goes to the rooftop of the hotel and meets with Verona , Carlito , and his henchmen . Carlito takes out a syringe , filled with the same poison used by Verona . As he is about to kill Chelios by injecting the second dose into him , Don Kim , revealed to be alive as Chelios spared him , arrives with his Triads to assist Chelios and a shootout follows . During the battle , several of Don Kim s and all of Carlito s men are killed . Carlito tries to escape with his private helicopter , but Chelios manages to catch up to him and holds him at gunpoint . Before Chelios can kill Carlito , Verona sneaks behind and injects Chelios with the syringe , after which Chelios collapses . Carlito himself is betrayed by Verona , who shoots him to death and then tries to escape with his helicopter . Chelios manages to stand up , boards the helicopter , and engages in a fight with Verona . After some struggle , Chelios manages to pull Verona out of the helicopter and while mid-air , Chelios proceeds to snap Verona s neck , killing him . While falling , Chelios calls Eve on his cell phone to apologize for not coming back . Chelios hits a car , bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera . In the last shot , it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast ; his nostrils flare , he blinks , and two heartbeats are heard .
