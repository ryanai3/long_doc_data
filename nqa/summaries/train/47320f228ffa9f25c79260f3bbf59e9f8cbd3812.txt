Six months after the events of the first film , Neo ( Keanu Reeves ) and Trinity ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) are now a couple . Morpheus ( Laurence Fishburne ) receives a message from Captain Niobe ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all of Zion s ships . Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris : an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours . Commander Lock ( Harry Lennix ) orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught , but Morpheus asks one ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle ( Gloria Foster ) . The Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle , and the Nebuchadnezzar ventures out so Neo can contact her . One of the Caduceus crew , Bane ( Ian Bliss ) , encounters Agent Smith ( Hugo Weaving ) , who takes over Bane s avatar . Smith then uses this avatar to leave the Matrix , gaining control of Bane s real body . In Zion , Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people . Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix to meet her bodyguard Seraph ( Collin Chou ) , who then leads him to her . After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix , Neo asks how he can trust her ; she replies that it is his decision . The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the Keymaker ( Randall Duk Kim ) , a prisoner of the Merovingian ( Lambert Wilson ) . As the Oracle departs , Smith appears , telling Neo that after being defeated , he refused to be deleted , and is now a rogue program . He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix , including other Agents , as hosts . He then tries to absorb Neo as a host , but fails , prompting a battle between Smith s clones and Neo . Neo manages to defend himself , but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers . Neo , Morpheus , and Trinity visit the Merovingian and ask for the Keymaker , but the Merovingian refuses . His wife Persephone ( Monica Bellucci ) , seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity , betrays him and leads the trio to the Keymaker . The Merovingian soon arrives with his men . Morpheus , Trinity and the Keymaker escape , while Neo holds off the Merovingian s servants . Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker on the freeway , facing several Agents and the Twins , the Merovingian s chief henchmen . Morpheus defeats the Twins , Trinity escapes , and Neo flies in to save Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson . In the real world , Zion s remaining ships prepare to battle the machines . Within the Matrix , the crews of the Nebuchadnezzar , Vigilant and Logos help the Keymaker and Neo reach the door to the Source . The crew of the Logos must destroy a power plant to prevent a security system from being triggered , and the crew of the Vigilant must destroy a back-up power station . The Logos succeeds , while the Vigilant is bombed by a Sentinel in the real world , killing everyone on board . Although Neo asked Trinity to remain on the Nebuchadnezzar , she enters the Matrix to replace the Vigilant crew and complete their mission . However , her escape is compromised by an Agent , and they fight . As Neo , Morpheus , and the Keymaker try to reach the Source , the Smiths appear and try to kill them . The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source , allowing Neo and Morpheus to enter and escape from the Smiths , but the Smiths kill the Keymaker while he tries to close the door to the Source . Neo enters a door and meets a program called the Architect , the Matrix s creator . The Architect explains that Neo is part of the design of the sixth iteration of Matrix , designed to stop the fatal system crash that naturally occurs due to the concept of human choice . As with the five previous Ones , Neo can choose either to return to the Source with his unique code to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to begin to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion , or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it ; combined with Zion s destruction , this would mean mankind s extinction . Neo learns of Trinity s situation and chooses to save her instead . As she falls off a building , he flies in and catches her , then by somehow phasing his hand into her body he removes a bullet from her body and restarts her heart . Back in the real world , Sentinels destroy the Nebuchadnezzar . Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts , but falls into a coma from the effort . The crew are picked up by another ship , the Hammer . Its captain , Roland , reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an EMP too early , and that they found only one survivor afterwardsârevealed to be the Smith-possessed Bane .
