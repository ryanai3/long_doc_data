Koreeda s After Life is set in a waystation where the souls of the recently deceased are processed before entering heaven . Heaven , for the film , is a single happy memory from one s life , re-experienced for eternity . The movie is set in a building resembling a decrepit government social services institution . Every Monday , a new group of recently deceased people check in , and the social workers in the lodge explain to each guest their situation . The newly-dead have until Wednesday to identify the single happiest memory . For the rest of the week , the workers at the institution work to design and replicate each person s chosen memory , thereby replicating the single happiest moment of that person s life . This moment is staged and filmed . At the end of the week , the recently deceased watch the films of their recreated happiest memories in a screening room . As soon as each person sees his or her own memory , he or she vanishes to whatever unknown state of existence lies beyond and takes only that single memory with them . The story pays most attention to two of the counselors , Takashi ( Arata ) and Shiori ( Oda ) . Takashi has been assigned to help an old man , Ichiro ( played by Naito Taketoshi ) , select his memory . Takashi reviews videotape of Ichiro s life and learns that Ichiro had married Takashi s former fiancĂŠe after Takashi had been killed during World War II . Takashi has Ichiro assigned to another counselor , but is still troubled by his memories , causing both him and his quasi-romantic interest Shiori to re-examine their ( after- ) lives .
