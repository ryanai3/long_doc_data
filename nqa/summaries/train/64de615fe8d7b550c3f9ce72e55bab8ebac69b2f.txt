Naive and idealistic insurance agent Tim Lippe welcomes a former teacher into his home , addressing her as Mrs. Vanderhei . After having sex with her , he reminisces about his experiences as her student . In his position as an insurance agent , he is sent to represent his company , Brownstar Insurance , at a regional conference in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , as a replacement for his co-worker , Roger Lemke , who died in an auto-erotic asphyxiation accident . Tim idolized Roger , believing that his death was merely an unfortunate accident , and that he embodied all it was to be a moral Christian , the key criterion used to judge the winner of the coveted Two Diamonds award , which Roger had won three years in a row . Tim s boss , Bill , pressures him to win again to ensure they keep the company afloat . At the conference , Lippe meets fellow insurance agents Ronald Ronimal Wilkes , Dean Dean-Z Ziegler , and Joan O-Fox Ostrowski-Fox . He also meets Bree , a sex worker who works the parking lot in front of the hotel . She affectionately calls him Butterscotch after he offers her candy . Initially wary of the conference-goers , he spends more time with Ron , Dean , and Joan , and develops genuine friendships , including a crush on Joan . All the insurance agents participate in a scavenger hunt . Tim is paired with Joan , and , after they win , they become intoxicated with Dean in the hotel swimming pool . Tim and Joan s sexual tension builds to a head and , after making out in the pool , they have sex in Joan s hotel room . They were all seen in the pool by ASMI president Orin Helgesson . The next morning , Tim is guilt-ridden and calls Vanderhei to confess , before desperately asking her to marry him . After explaining she has been sleeping with other people and desires freedom , she suggests he take the opportunity to start a new life . Tim returns to Joan , who attempts to comfort him by telling him what Lemke was really like : she was his lover but left him after his sexual appetites became too twisted for her , and he bribed Helgesson for each one of his awards . Tim refuses to believe this and flees Joan s room , accusing her of being a prostitute sent to destroy his life . He runs into Dean and accidentally lets slip Lemke s bribery . As his friend , Dean swears to not tell anyone . After receiving advice from Dean , Tim goes to Helgesson for his assessment ; it does not go well , and under the pressure he ends up also bribing Helgesson for the award , leaving him penniless and ashamed . Tim later comes across Bree and accompanies her to a party , where he gets high on crystal methamphetamine and inadvertently starts a fight . Ron , Joan , and Dean show up just in time to rescue him and Bree , who says she is in love with Tim . The night ends as Bill appears at Tim s door to inform him that with the successful acquisition of another Two Diamond award , he has received a generous offer for the company ; despite meaning the branch s closure , he has chosen to sell . While Bill formally announces the sale , Tim bursts in , takes over the podium , and reveals that his company has unethically acquired the award every year by bribing Helgesson and confesses to doing so himself . Helgesson flees the room , his reputation in tatters , and a furious Bill confronts Tim , his revelations having cost Bill the sale of his company . Tim responds by announcing his intention to leave the company and start another with his clients from Brownstar , 17 of which have agreed to stay with him . Bill storms off , dumbfounded . As the four friends say their goodbyes and prepare to see each other next year , Joan and Tim are shown happy as friends , and Dean invites Ron and Tim to stay at a wealthy friend s cabin in Canada for the summer ; both of them surprise Dean by gleefully accepting . The three of them go on to start their own company together called Top Notch , with Joan involved , too .
